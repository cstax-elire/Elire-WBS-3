# Strategic Plan

###### S T R AT E G Y S E S S I ON

###### P R E-R E A D

## Preparing for Our Session

- The mini-team information has been summarized in order to simplify consumption of the material.

```
Participants are welcome to review the full set of mini-team prework on the Teams site under the Files
tab on the General Channel.
```

- Please note that all summarized information should be considered “work-in-progress” and serves simply

as a starting point for developing the Elire 3-year strategy.

Objectives for the three days

- Day 1: We will spend most of day one reflecting on the mini-team outputs and creating a “consensus”

view for Elire. Please complete the pre-reads as outlined on slide 4 below.

- Day 2: We will focus on defining strategic choices –the “what” of our strategy. After all a great strategic

plan is about clarity. Please note that the Board of Advisors will join for the afternoon of Day 2.

- Day 3: we will focus on developing a roadmap to execute –the “how” of our strategy. We know that

```
understanding the “how” will allow us develop commitment to the choices we made and ensure
congruence/ alignment that incentivizes the how to become reality.
```

# SWOT

###### S U M M A RY

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Strengths

- Company culture (team motivation and success, committed to clients’ success, collaboration working across areas, passion about being trusted advisor, access to leadership,
  etc.) that is nurtured through multiple channels
- Team member experience, depth of Friends of Elire network on most mature offerings with strong underpinning of core business process knowledge that helps those
  offerings but also helps create a niche on PSFT to Cloud
- Proprietary methodology and accelerator tools that can serve as true differentiators
- Mature service offerings and methodologies for application roadmap, optimization, and business process improvement combined with in-depth knowledge of our clients'
  different systems allows us to tailor solutions and more fully service our clients ‘needs (People, Process, Technology) in a nimble way
- Ability to use both an onshore presence and a nearshore/offshore presence, as required
- Committed and long-term customers, strategic relationships, Practice lead Rolodex and client touch
- Ability to respond to customer needs – nimble: adjust offerings, components of deal
- Ability to complete internal projects to continuously improve Elire based upon the guide of the Annual Survey, the external Board, the Professional Services Maturity Model
- Dedicated PMO, data visualization, process experts
- Marketing content compared to peers
- Increasingly strong internal Financial controls and accountability
- Best in class systems have been implemented across all major areas
- Competitive benefits: Unlimited PTO, commissions, hybrid work model, bonuses
- Cloud based SaaS for internal IT with excellent customer support

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Weaknesses

- Consistency of tools/methodologies usage across practice areas and the use of the best-in-class systems we implemented to help areas run more effectively
- Challenging resource mixes and types that require higher pricing in many instances and don’t create the correct internal incentives to achieve a more ideal Consulting Pyramid
- Federal Government Challenges – endanger of retaining "small business" classification, lack of Federal Contracts (GSA, IP4,etc), knowledge of how Federal Govt Contracts & Projects executed, not a MWBE
- Inexperienced teams, resources past their prime, need to retool resource mix
- Underexperienced managers able to develop authentic relationships where able to provide opportunities to Lead, Learn and Feel Proud in a Psychologically Safe environment and successfully manage
  capability gaps (skill profiles), motivation gap (desire profiles), and license gaps (agency profiles). Ultimately, drive firm growth, reduce attrition, grow the next generation of leaders
- Inconsistent maintenance of internal application instances necessary to support sales and customer demos often supporting new business opportunities
- Underdeveloped Success Stories that lack easy to tell realized benefits stories tailored to client P&L owners and that highlight true Elire differentiators, often rely on same 5-10, must communicate value
- Underdeveloped offerings and marketing for change management, data analytics, training, and testing that limit the ability to present more fully realized transformational solutions to our clients
  (perception that application oriented only)
- Underdeveloped sales strategy that lacks consistency/robustness and inhibits cross COE selling – focused on siloed solutions rather than comprehensive client transformation, Lead gen (outside of personal
  relationships) – hyper focus on events vs. continuous campaigning, nurturing
- Immature and inconsistent training and development of resources - Growth, development and learning, certifications, soft skills. New hire onboarding/training process
- Limited Strategic Partners – Need to expand and deepen our relationships with oracle representatives which allows us to service new areas.
- Reliance on delivery team for all things oracle cloud... need more knowledge in Solution Center
- Experience in emerging tech, e.g., AI, blockchain
- Sales / marketing / recruiting / delivery prioritization coordination and alignment, accountability to critical tasks assigned by Pillars
- Not enough competitor analysis or analysis of market needs that are driving/impacting key industries or functions (CFO, CHRO) and therefore a lack of ability for Elire to properly respond
- Lack of depth for Recruiting , lack of visibility into skills needed to be successful on projects, lessening of nurturing of the Friends of Elire network
- Need to better utilize PSA / ERP dashboards, reporting, and other capabilities
- Small IT staff, lack of overall employee awareness for importance of IT security, End users’ devices/software not centrally managed

```
ELIRE INC. 2022

## Opportunities

- Growing markets: Fed gov’t, Higher Ed, Healthcare
- Advancement in procure to pay space and also AP automation
- Companies need for future state application and roadmap (Oracle), migration to Cloud
- Partnership opportunities, e.g. Oracle, AP providers, new verticals, etc.
- Vacancy of larger integrators from the PS market
- Heavy client investment in space despite mature market
- New and emerging tech - Oracle is continuing to pour billions of R&D money into their cloud platforms, analytics, and even PSFT
- Emerging customer needs (meet via targeted service offerings)
- Oracle Guided Learning market
- Customer resources supporting PeopleSoft are beginning to retire and/or migrate over to various other technologies opening the door for additional consulting support
  opportunities and opening the door for lesser experienced consultants to be accepted and successful on projects
- Changes in ERP create need for Success Hub solutions, complement other Elire offerings
- Wellness programs are becoming larger trend in workforce
- Changing talent / work force dynamics: ability to source due to remote work, etc
- Changing and improving expectations and technologies that would allow larger volumes to more easily move through an expanded Talent candidate funnel (AI interview
  applications, testing, and video)
- Shifting trends towards willingness to have a Technology / Administration / Data Security fee to client SOWs

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Threats

- Market saturation, entering/expanding into crowded markets (e.g., Success Hub, Data analytics, Success Hubs, etc.), pricing pressure that threatens to commoditize services
- Niche competitors and lower cost service providers penetrate market
- Scarcity of key skills in the market, how to get Managed service consultants to go into MS when standard delivery is remote, drive toward projects in the Fed space require
  more harder to find US Citizens
- Larger complex projects in complex markets and industries bring inherent risks and threats
- Economic turmoil and inflation, rising costs of health care, etc
- Lower corporate investment budgets
- Emerging tech
- Oracle as only driver of market potential, Oracle strategy changes, changing personnel, changing focus
- Oracle changing reps drive loss of relationships
- Dynamic ERP drives havoc on maintenance
- Changing requirements for certifications
- Employee expectations for comp. increasing, Gen Z expectations, remote workforce trends
- Remote work culture threatening the “roll my chair” over culture that consulting depends upon to mentor, nurture employees
- Increased complexity in state taxation, registration, and reporting (where did you do the work)
- Increasingly sophisticated hacking and phishing attacks

## Pre-work

- What strengths are most critical to preserve?
- What weaknesses are most critical to resolve?
- What external factors must be acted upon (opportunities and threats)?

**Competitive Advantage**

```
Market Attractiveness
Key Insights
```

- PeopleSoft to Cloud is very attractive to the
  market, and Elire has a strong competitive
  advantage in this area
- Biggest Comp adv (PS) for Elire is low on market
  attractiveness
- Opportunity in Cloud ERP because of market
  attractiveness
- 1 - 2 Big Dots and the rest are relatively small
- Strengths in PS, Cloud HCM, and Treasury.
  Weakness in standalone sales for supporting
  practices of TRAS, SAS, Nearshore, MS, Cloud
  ERP, PMO
- Important to have all of these capabilities to
  support our key areas, but not as important to
  market all of them as standalone services.
- This aligns with our SWOT analysis on what
  practice areas are tough to sell, low on revenue,
  low on market demand.

## Utilization and Margin Analysis – 2022

```
Key implications and insights
```

- Strategic Advisory Services and TRAS are
  two areas with the highest Gross Profit
  Margin with SAS at a 79% utilization rate;
  TRAS is lower at only 44%. Both Practices
  combined are only 8% of revenue
- PeopleSoft makes up the highest
  percentage of revenue (38%) and is the
  utilized the highest (94%) but is tied with
  Kyriba, and Solution Center COE with the
  lowest GPM (27%)
- Cloud ERP, Cloud HCM, PS Treasury and
  PeopleSoft all have > 80% utilization but are
  all under 35% GPM

- The Gross Profit Margin dropped overall from 2021 to 2022 in nearly all Practices, mainly due to wage increases without an
  increased bill rate to support the cost.
- Utilization picked up and we became more efficient but increasing employee & sub costs eroded any efficiency gains we may
  have gained from the utilization pickup.

Key Insights
```

- HCM has solid quals for full suite implementations, but we haven’t
  had a go-live since Jan 2020. We need go-lives to get certifications
  so that we are a qualified implementation partner
- ERP has its first full suite implementation going on now with CGS –
  this is a critical qual for us to get more work
- Market is very large and we’re very immature in processes and
  expertise – HCM has found its success with large full suite
  implementations, ERP has found its success with optimization
  work
- We outsource EPM now, would like to bring that in house via
  acquisition or developing internal expertise
- Our COE is already in 3 large areas where we don’t have a name
  enough to break out into a new SaaS offering (Oracle HCM, ERP,
  EPM cloud). For the next 3 years, we need to focus solely on
  Oracle Cloud
- One of our top competitive advantages is having PeopleSoft and
  Cloud expertise in our firm – we are one of the only firms with as
  deep of a PeopleSoft practice that also has a cloud practice
- Need to mature and grow our core competency areas – Base
  installations of Cloud HCM and ERP and develop optimization and
  Day 2 differentiators

```
Bubbles = practice areas
Size of bubble = $Revenue in millions (round to 1

```

## Unique and Important

**Core Implementation (day 1 services)** – getting clients live with base system: Every
consulting firm has a methodology
**EBS or other systems to cloud** – We don’t understand EBS or other on prem
applications, but we do need to convert organizations from these systems. We don’t
have the same compelling PeopleSoft to cloud story, but we’ve had success with
migrating customers from other systems. The approach is slightly different, but we
need to be at par with other organizations that move clients from these systems,
especially EBS
**Doing managed services** – we need to be able to at least be on par doing managed
services for our clients

```
PeopleSoft to Cloud – Elire is one of the only firms in the market with deep PeopleSoft experience that
also has a cloud practice. We’ve had almost all of our HCM success because of existing PeopleSoft
clients. We have tools to help clients move to cloud and need to continue developing these tools and
build marketing around it
Transformational approach to implementation: from how we consult during RFP process, to P0 – how
we introduce the software, to how we help them unlock the potential of the software
Trusted Advisor: Our best clients are clients that view us as their trusted advisor. They know if they pick
up the phone and call practice lead or partner, they will get the answer resolved – it’s a white glove
service. But to be our clients true trusted advisor, we need to understand their industry and the
problems they face and develop trust because we have a methodology that can deliver results. Our
methodology needs work on relationships more, and we need to elevate the level of expertise in our
consulting base
Day 0 Services : Helping our clients on their cloud journey while they’re still on prem (especially
peoplesoft clients) – Aspirational – need to do a better job partnering with MAS and OnPrem to be
successful here
Day 2 services: We don’t have this yet, but we’re seeing this as a very large opportunity. When we have
a niche skill set area for an emerging tech, we can do a marketing campaign and get new opportunities
which lead to add on work. We aspire to be though leaders in unlocking the potential of the cloud to
give customers the vision of what oracle sees the software being
```

**Low percentage wins** : Going after projects where we don’t have an advantage (oracle
backs us, existing relationship, compelling story because of industry knowledge, etc).
We’ve spent a lot of times on RFPs with low percentage wins. Often, we’re trying to
take what we can get, and if we do win, we create a new potential market.

```
Federal Market Expertise – huge opportunity but we do not yet have the knowledge needed – actively
working on building out
ELIRE INC. 2022ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Growth Opportunities

```
EPM – we currently outsource all opportunities
Federal Cloud – most still on PeopleSoft HR, good oracle alignment
Oracle Integration Cloud – Important tool for cloud transformations, limited in house expertise
ElireConversion Toolkit – helps our story of PeopleSoft to Cloud
OCI, AWS, Azure/Cloud infrastructure – Not a market we currently address. could be huge for PS
clients that don’t want to move to fusion or to more fully assist clients on cloud journey
DevOps - Might align more with Managed Services, but this is a skill set we don’t have, but growing
market
VBCS, APEX – Aligns with oracle’s strategy of cloud personalization
Tribes – new market that aligns with oracle objectives and our strongest oracle cloud relationships,
most still on legacy erpsand just starting transitions to cloud
State/Local – huge market that we haven’t had a lot of success in Cloud yet, but do have cloud
resources with a lot of experience
Oracle Cloud SCM – Cloud suite that we have limited experience with, but have an
internal resource with a lot of experience. SCM is very early in adoption and maturity
AI – Huge oracle investment, ultimate goal of the cloud strategy, still immature
Digital Assistant – large oracle investment, gaining traction, still immature, have some
internal expertise and one client that piloted (US Navy) and an external resource that is
very skilled
AP IDR – Oracle’s new AP imaging technology –will be bundled into the application and
large oracle investment. Plays into our MAS expertise in this area
BankBridge – Cloud ERP clients that want a bank integration solution
Rev Rec, Lease Accounting – success in on prem, could have large implications in cloud
Joint Ventures (setup in cloud) – we have experience because of CGS and see this as a
growth area for complex government contracting companies
RPA – MAS has done some work here, has potential in cloud
SCM – We have unique existing skillset in Cloud ERP practice and potential clients from
these resources
Oracle Cloud ERP (financials) – this is our core ERP practice competency –we’re still very early in
growth (both Elireand Oracle) and there is a lot of opportunity as customers transition to cloud
Oracle Cloud HCM – We have quals and experience, market is maturing, need to continue building our
internal competencies
PeopleSoft customers – One of our core differentiators is moving PeopleSoft to cloud –any PeopleSoft
customer should be a target
Existing PeopleSoft clients – our existing PeopleSoft client base is our best source of new cloud
customers. We’ve had success here and need to continue
DOE market – we are recognized in the lab community due to past success –we should have a
cohesive strategy for all labs and sites should have a strategy for their path to cloud
Financial Services and Utility Industry – we’ve had a lot of PeopleSoft and cloud erp success in
Financial Services and PeopleSoft and cloud hcm in utilities
Advisory/support – We’ve done some advisory and support and had success –continue
Day 0/Day 1/Day 2 Services - With HCM, we are doing well with Day 1, with ERP Day 2 –need to be
great in both for each practice and extend to day 0 (see next slides)
E Payments (p card, virtual card) – a lot of success, but no marketing yet around success
in this market. Need to build out competency and showcase successes
ADP Tax Filings – Oracle does not deliver reports for tax filings. ADP and Ceridian are
primary providers, with ADP being most common. Our clients do not like ADP. PeopleSoft
delivered this out of the box. We built a handful of states for ASRC and could develop
reports for all state and resell for future clients.
Oracle Me, Journeys – Bells and whistles of the product that are one of the value props
for oracle hcm. This is usually add on work after Day 1 implementation. We need to do
Day 1 well enough to stay with client for Day 2 and have Day 2 services for new clients
that are unsatisfied with existing SI
Automated Testing – Oracle delivers patches quarterly and customers need to test their
system. PeopleSoft automated testing has been successful at Elire–we have developed a
strategy, but haven’t yet found a customer. We need to refine our strategy –our current
automated testing strategy needs to be more comprehensive (in progress)

**Day 0 Services** – Preplanning for cloud transition

- Path to cloud/journey to cloud. We need to partner with MAS and OnPrem to build this out fully.
- We need to be part of our customers cloud j ourney from start to finish.
- Day 0 is all of the work we can be doing together to understand where they are on their roadmap, helping them with their roadmap, prepping them for their transition for cloud (especially for our existing active PS
  customers ), helping them with expectations of what a transformation looks like, and then ultimately feeding them into our cloud delivery teams. We need to utilize the tools built by the OnPrem team to help us understand
  where they are in their PeopleS oft journey to better as ses s and evaluate what their path to cloud looks like and partner with SAS to help them define their roadmap and business process redesign opportunities
  **Day 1 Services** – Implementation
- For Day 0 customers, this is an easier path - we know them, we know how to move them and what their pain points are and we know how to scope the project and set expectations for a s mooth transition.
- This is laying the groundwork – its not the bells and whistles you see in the oracle demos – its setting the foundation for the bells and whistles. We need to improve our methodology so that we are better at performing
  these transitions and we need to be better at setting expectations so that they know this is just step 1 in their journey.
- We need to also keep in mind that many of our clients won’t be Day 0 customers (RFP responses where we don’t have knowledge of where they’re at and what they’re doing). For these ”Blind” rfp res ponses , we need to do
  a better job of telling the story in our RFPs so that we appropriately set expectations. This is just Day 1...we need to lay the foundation
- We need a more repeatable and lower cost implementation methodolog y to make sure we get to day 2 as well as consultants that are trained on our methodology
  **Day 2 Services** – this is where the fun begins
- The ultimate vision of these cloud systems are big ideas like automated payroll or month end closes using AI. Some of that is still a ways out in the future, but some of these future state visions are here now.
- Day 2 is about building out true business value for our customers – this is where we see real ROI.
- In the OnPrem model, we used to be able to rely on upgrades. Once people implemented PeopleSoft, 3-5 years later, they would upgrade. Recently, we’ve been shortening that window due to PUM updates, but it had the
  potential to be a more reliable revenue stream. With cloud, this has the potential to be the clients LAST implementation. Updates are automatic. H ow does a s ervice company make money once all customers are on
  cloud?? New features and functionality. There will ALWAYS be new features and functionality – but we need to change our approach to capture business. Rather than simply upgrading, we need to be thought leaders and
  be on top of trends in the product. We need to partner with our clients
- We have 3 main entry points.
  1. Customers that we performed Day 1 – these are cus tomers we know. We know what went well, what needs to be optimized and what the future looks like. We need to develop a strategy for these customers to
     help them on their journey. Oracle is always adding new features and functionality – we need to stay on top of trends and advise and engage with them on understanding if they know the trend/new area and then
     being able to guide them on that journey (great example is autocomplete in HC M – Cloud world interactions with Yum allowed Aaron to recognize an opportunity and create an opportunity on helping them with
     this new technology)
  2. Customers that have failed or unsatisfactory D ay 1 implementations - we’ve had a lot of success in cloud erp in this space. SI that didn’t’ meet expectations or simply looking for a new partner
  3. Marketing: S howcasing our expertise in being able to help clients recognize the value in their cloud systems. This is a two part strategy – first, staying on top of trends and being able to demonstrate value, and
     next, being able to convey the value and get the message out through marketing and relationships. A two fold example – new technology in oracle cloud called auto complete – Karen Long is doing work at INL on
     the technology. Marketing made a YouTube video, Lucas county reached out and we’ve now had several conversations to replace their incumbent SI. Same technology, but looking at the relations hip side, Aaron
     met with Yum at Cloud World conference and found out they are struggling with the same technology. Suggested Karen and we are now working on an S OW that should be s igned in the next week

What capabilities and resources will be needed to capture the value of these opportunities

- PeopleSoft to Cloud
  - Develop Tools and accelerators to help PeopleSoft clients move to cloud (Cloud Conversion Toolkit)
  - Develop strategy for existing clients and understand their path to cloud
  - Incorporate PeopleSoft customization identification tool and SAS Roadmap into cohesive methodology for transformation
- Federal Cloud
  - Continue to develop oracle relationships – Tamara and her reps
  - Complete JV with Metric5
  - Develop in house contract expertise to handle federal contracts
- Methodology
  - Lower Cost and more repeatable Execution model
- Sales Strategy
  - External relationships – within oracle and leveraging trusted clients
  - Cohesive messaging on what we do
  - Referenceable customers
- Structure and Training
  - Need to be able to carry a bench going forward – operating at 100% capacity was not allowing us to chase new opportunities and when Sandia and Hanford fell
    through, we did not have a backlog of services
  - Grow internal consulting knowledge
  - Consulting training – module, roadmap, consulting 101
- Industry Knowledge
  - To be our clients trusted advisors, we need to be able to understand the problems they face. Its not enough to say we understand the software, we need to
    understand their industry and the unique solutions that can help them in their cloud transformation.
  - Strongest existing markets – utilities, financial services, labs. Out of those, in the lab space, we are building repeatable solutions, but we still are very immature
    in understanding how their business actually works
  - New markets we need to understand – Tribes, Federal, State/Local

- The Pillar has struggled to hit
  utilization goals due to issues
  in a few practices, such as
  TRAS and SaaS TR
- Average project profit margin
  is also below goal primarily
  due to the use of higher cost
  subcontractors although bill
  rates have been increasing
  over time, which should help
- The Pillar needs to continue
  to improve QA checks and
  expand the use of PSA to
  proactively monitor projects

ELIRE INC. 2022

## Pillar Progress and Vision

**Capability area Reflection +/- 2025 where are we going?**

1. Use of PSA for Project and Resource
   Management supported by a PMO with
   quality reviews & measurements
   - Deployed PSA for basic use and
     are actively taking steps to use in
     a more advanced & integrated
     way
   - PMO Health checks have stalled
     but restarting
     \- Want to use PSA to support sales cycle, as well
     as to support project status reporting
     \- Want an independent quality review team to
     ensure living up to Trusted Advisor status
2. Collaborative Portal • Working to deploy better
   organized MS Teams and
   Sharepoint
   \- Build a db of methodology and deliverable
   examples. Harvest good examples of
   deliverables at project close and ensure
   documents are tagged for searching
3. Critical thinking skills to solve client
   problems, mitigate risk and introduce best
   practices
   - Consultants know how to
     configure applications but are
     always providing thought
     leadership on process
     transformation
     \- Want consultants to more proactively provide
     advice to clients to transform there processes
     rather than lift & shift
4. Effective Change Management • Have basic change management
   for ERP projects
   \- Want PROSCI enabled OCM integrated into all
   applicable methodologies
5. Expand industry specific expertise for
   COEs
   - We know the app but lack deep
     expertise in targeted industries
     \- Need to understand their specific problems
     that need to be solved to be a trusted advisor

## Pre-work

- Across the pillars, what are the 3 most critical capabilities we must invest in?

## Talent of the Future

ELIRE INC. 2022

#### Professional

#### Services Maturity

#### Benchmark

```
Unlike other Professional Service
Firms, our IT consulting model does
not support consistently reliable
underutilized Delivery roles other
than the SDM role
Elire currently uses 30-40% 1099
Contractors rather than the
Benchmark 13-14% for IT
Consulting firms
```

## Elire Today - Client Delivery

```
Tier 1: Associates & Consultants: 17
Tier 2: Senior & Managing: 27
Tier 3: Principle & Solution Architect: 17
Tier 4: Practice Leads &
Associate Practice
Leads: 10
```

Elire is not so much a pyramid as a diamond

Some areas have no Tier 3 resources

Some areas have no Tier 1 resources

Elire has a proven history of being able to take
individuals whom it was considered impossible
to remove from the day to day of projects
(COEs). This was achieved by creating Practice
Leads. Many of the Practice Leads have now
significantly reduced their Utilization.

We can continue forward if we have an
increased number of solid resources at Tier 3
who are able to be Project PMs, Thread Leads,
Team Leads, etc. That need is essential.

## Elire Leader of the Future

*Attributes of anElireleader of the future: growing middle leadership is important as we grow, what are our expectations for
leaders at Elire?*

- **Skills:** Coach and Mentor mentality
- **Expectations:** A top Elire priority must prioritize Growing and Nurturing Team Elire by developing authentic manager

```
relationships where they provide opportunities to Lead, Learn and Feel Proud in a Psychologically Safe environment and
where they know how to successfully manage capability gaps (skill profiles), motivation gap (desire profiles), and license
gaps (agency profiles). Ultimately, drive firm growth, reducing attrition, growing the next generation of leaders
```

- **Behaviors:** Self-motivated, thought leader in area, fluid, adaptable, passionate, professional, nurturing, and authentically
  engaging
- **Actions:**
  - Develop/purchase necessary management training courses for all people managers
  - Teach our managers how to achieve the above expectations
  - Add additional layers of management and engagement support systems to improve the span of control

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

- Identify those higher order key tasks that **should** be performed by COE and
  Practice Leadership and **re-allocate all** other tasks
- **Remove lower value tasks to other FTEs**
  o **Pillar or Group of COE Admin Assistant (Cost)** : Scheduling meetings, routine
  follow-up, assist with RFP template first drafts, estimators first draft, assist
  with project-based review logistics, training and other follow-up
  o **PMO - Project Analyst/Coordinator (indirectly Covered):** Project onboarding
  support; Project Teams/SharePoint support; SOW spend analysis; anything
  PSA: assignments, Vendor Budget, non “auto approval” time/invoice approval
  (F&O already working to increase “auto approval” on timecard and invoices),
  resource extensions, data audits; project scorecard/plan tasks (monitoring,
  follow up on action items, deadline reviews). Paid via SOW fee
- Different from Billable PMs
  o **Reviews** : Move from Practice Lead driven at Mid Year, End of Year to more
  frequent Project Based Reviews given by Project Leader that knows resource
  best (see slide 82)
- **Allow Focus on**
  o Strategy (alignment of Service Offerings to marketplace needs)
  o Sales Management (including Strategic Partner and Client Executive
  Relationships)
  o Delivery Management via SDM roles to ensure Success Delivered

### Reallocate

### Lower Value

### Add Tasks

Address the “Additive Nature” of
the Practice Lead Position

Key to the Pyramid

**Delivery Teams (Tier 1-3): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Success Delivered*
- To help ensure more timely reviews and lead to better overall project performance, delivery consultants

```
would NOW receive a Performance Review at the end of each Project or at the end of Key Milestones.
Should Project Timelines prevent individuals from being reviewed more than once per year
```

- Reviews will be conducted by the resource’s designated Sub Team Lead, Team Lead, Thread Lead, or Project

```
Lead depending upon the size and complexity of the Project. IF there is no Elire designated individual able
to perform that role, the review will be done at the Practice Leadership level
```

- *Rationale* : Most projects are 7 months so most would have at least two project ending reviews and/or a

```
key milestone reviews a year. The designated Elire Lead knows the Team Elire resource better than anyone
for the duration of the project. This should improve the overall accuracy of reviews and help ensure that
resources are set-up for success on their next project. This will also spread reviews throughout the year
rather than consolidating them at the Mid Year Point. The Year End process will simply aggregate reviews.
```

- Reviews will be aggregated at the end of the year by Practice Leadership

**Day to Day Project Supervisors (Tier 3): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Day to Day Project Supervisor for the duration of the Project ensuring Success Delivered and*

*Provide Project Ending/Key Milestone Reviews to their Project Team*

- Roles: Serve as Team Leads, Thread Leads, Project PMs depending on size and complexity of project
- Rationale: Need a core group of solid Project Leads who can be relied upon to deliver success outside of

```
the COE and Practice Lead to allow Practice Leads and Associate Practice Leads to scale back their
Utilization.
```

- ***Oversight of Day to Day Project Team Members.\*** **Provide on the job training and mentoring, oversee**

```
deliverables, provide soft skills coaching all with the goal of ensuring Project Success. Help ensure the
"roll my chair over" culture of project support.
```

- ***Add a grade/score for 1099 Contractors - Friends of Elire\***
- *Goal: Oversite of teams of 4-12 made up of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 who are overseen on a day-to-day basis by*

*the Elire Team Lead, Thread Lead, Project PM. Standard 83% utilization*

**Associate Practice Leads (Tier 4):** ***new\***

- *Primary Focus: Delivery Support, Client Engagement*
- Roles: SDM on no more than 3-4 projects
- Rationale: Client Engagement via SDM role focusing on understanding the transformational needs of the client that can

```
be addressed by Elire's offerings (allow better penetration and cross selling) and then ensure projects beneath are
running smoothly, coordinate with PMO accordingly. Must nurture deeper, longer-term relationships
```

- ***Oversight of Day to Day Project Supervisors on 3-4 projects where have SDM responsibility. Ensure project-based\***

```
reviews are occurring. Option to have direct line employees IF the Practice organizes resources by function or type
```

- **Bi-annual Career Growth/Purpose conversations for those with direct day to day project supervisors as they are getting**

```
detailed reviews but still need career growth guidance. Provide BOTH core project reviews and career growth/purpose
guidance for those WITHOUT a day-to-day Elire Supervisor on a Project
```

- *Goal: Oversite of no more than 3-4 projects (20-30 FTEs max) depending upon their size and complexity therefore the*

```
underlying teams would be 12 to 24. Four projects with 2-5 SDM hrs per week each is 8-20 hours (20% to 50% utilization)
```

- *Requires: A practice that has more than 3-4 projects with more than 20-30 FTEs* ***AND\*** *solid Tier 3 resources who can take*

```
on Project Leadership positions so the APL can focus on SDM roles only
```

**Practice Leads (Tier 4): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Sales Support, Strategic Direction of Practice, and P&L Management*
- Rationale: Research and understanding of key driving trends in key industries and transformational trends

```
that are motivating client P&L owners and then ensure Practice has the necessary Service Offerings with
the underlying methodology/tools/templates to ensure we can deliver success. Work with Client
Relationships to ensure RSMs and Sales Pods have the materials they need to be successful: Success
Stories, etc. to link "What We Do" to "What We Sell" in a coordinated Go to Market Strategy
```

- ***Oversight of Associate Practice Leads (new position see prior slide)\***
- **Monthly Practice Meeting: review Critical Communication Cascade, provide more detailed Quarterly**

**Meeting Updates on sales and financials as they are available**

- **Annual Aggregation of Review for Promotions and Raises**
- *Goal: 2 hrs per week Executive Committees and/or Client Executive Relationship Management on largest,*

*most strategic projects (5% utilization)*

- *Requires: Solid resources able to be Associate Practice Lead role at the desired Utilization and solid Tier 3*

**Center of Excellence Leads: exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Go to Market Sales Strategy for COE, Employee Engagement, High level Client and Strategic*

*Partner Executive Engagement*

- Rationale: Partners are the "special sauce" for authentic Employee Engagement and meaningful Executive

and Strategic Partner Relationships

- ***Oversight of Practice Leads, regularly check in on Practice Lead meetings and informally with team\***
- **Monitor key Service Execution Metrics for the COE and ensure overall financial health of COE**
- *Goal: 0% utilized while overseeing a max of 60-90 Employees/Billable FTEs*

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

- Today, the 3% is “given” simply for having billable resources. There
  was an assumption that Team Size and Utilization would naturally
  increase but the incentive has not been sufficient
- The goal would be to make participants ***earn\*** the percentages given
  in the same way that Partners must ***earn\*** the percentages given
- High-level look shows would have marginal impact on EBITA
