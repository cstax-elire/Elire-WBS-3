solutions as well as contract management and partnering.

  exists today due to lack of Delivery bandwidth

  \- Coordinate Service Offering and solution:
  definition and project estimate
  \- Coordinate Resource requirements, roles,
  responsibilities

Today

Today Tomorrow

Center of Excellence, Practices, and Focus Areas Concept

- **Center of Excellence**
  - Collection of profit centers (Practices) focused on specific product offerings or
    markets
  - Allow to be more laser focused and strategic at a higher level rather than the
    dozen plus practices today. Go to Market and Pillar Interlock strategies driven at
    this level
  - Allows for more streamlined sharing/pooling of resources across a strategic area
  - Oversight on the Budget and Personnel decisions
  - Led by a Partner or Associate Partner
- **Practice**
  - Profit Center with strong, consistent Sales and Resource Pipeline (Interlock)
  - Budgets produced and monitored
  - Employee Authority: Personnel decisions, Employee Reviews
  - Led by a Practice Lead that receives Practice Lead Commissions and who reports to
    the COE

Center of Excellence, Practices, and Focus Areas Concept

- **Focus Areas**
  - An area that meets agreed upon criteria and which is being nurtured by Elire
    through a demonstrated commitment of dollars and resources to determine if the
    Focus Area can evolve into a Practice **(turn idea into reality** )
  - Ensure that Elire is continuing to develop offerings for emerging markets and our
    clients’ evolving needs
  - Reports to the lead of the Center of Excellence or a Practice Lead within COE, as
    appropriate
  - Any resources not tied to a Practice would live within a pool at the Center of
    Excellence Level
  - Drive people, processes, system, as appropriate, for the development of the
    service offering
  - Drive alignment between the sales project pipeline and the resource management
    process (recruiting/human resource onboarding processes, resource skill
    development)

Center of Excellence Leads – Role and Responsibility

Goal: ***Evolve\*** the two-tier structure that exists today (Michael, Karen, Chris) into a true Strategic Pillar

- **Govern**
  - Direct line manager for all Practice Leads and those Focus Area Leads who would not report up to a Practice Lead
- **Dedicate 100 hours a year to Market Trend analysis** for COE and present back to leadership so Elire can be a Thought Leader
  - Read Business/Trade Media, attend Conferences, interview client Executives, join User Groups
- **Interlock Focus**
  - Coordinate Go to Market and Staffing Strategy for all Practices with Client Relationship and HCA Pillars
- **Lead Elire Key Client Mining Initiatives for past Clients**
  - Identify top Strategic Customers that we have done or are doing business with; focus on personal relationships
  - Debrief and gather intel – gather everything we know from all Elire resources involved
  - Meet with Client executives to validate problems (Need) and gather intel on Budget, Authority, Timeline – what is their strategic plan
  - Debrief – work across Elire to develop a go to market strategy for that client
- **Focus on the relationship of being a Trusted Advisor for existing Clients**
  - Attend (remote ok) all Project ***Executive\*** Steering Committees
  - On site quarterly meeting with Client Sponsors/Executives to have a focused discussion on satisfaction with Elire and opportunities to
    expand the Elire Service Offering footprint – discuss their strategic plan and associated strategic spend budget
- **Focus on being a Success Delivery Manager, where possible, with emphasis on Key Clients, Strategic Projects**
  - Goal is to be SDM on no more than 3 or so projects to ensure quality/attention
  - Work with Practice Leads on Project Profitability monitoring and general oversight to ensure Success Delivered

Practice Leads – Role and Responsibility

Goal: ***Evolve\*** to ensure critical tasks are accomplished

- **Grow the Practice**
  - **Achieve approved Sales Revenue goals of Practice Area**
    - Coordinate Sales and Resource Strategy with COE, CR and HCA Pillars
  - **Personal Utilization** targets reduced to ensure can focus on growing the Practice
  - **Focus on being a Success Delivery Manager where appropriate and at the discretion of COE**
- **Service Offering Management**
  - Work with the Service Execution Pillar to ensure can “Deliver what we Sell”
  - Actively work with Project Managers/Leads and PMO (being discussed later) to
    - Ensure that all Project Budget and Forecasts are accurate in Cloud ERP
    - Monitor Project Spend against the SOW and monitor Project Profitability
    - Monitor Project Timeline/Milestones and RAID items are actively being managed
- **Resource Management**
  - Lead Practice Meeting with all Practice personnel monthly and guide employee growth

  resource pipeline (similar skills), and delivery offerings around these strategic Centers of Excellence

  - Many of our relationships start with Advisory Services

Focus Area: Project Management Office

- **Having solid PMs involved in all projects would do more than any other action we could**
  **take to provide relief to our Partners, Associate Partners, and Practice Leads**
- Provide Project Management oversight and expertise to all Elire projects to ensure that
  projects are run smoothly, efficiently, and consistently
  \- Assist with Project Mobilization
  \- Ensure Service Execution methodologies, templates, tools are being used
  \- Work with the appropriate resources to ensure the project is on track and on budget
  \- Complete the Project Scorecard
- Offerings
  - Continue to provide standard, full-time PMs which the client would pay for
  - Client paid, part-time PMs, which we have not been able to really do before, as these
    part-time PMs could cover multiple projects
  - For those projects where the client does NOT want to pay for a PM, Elire would incur
    the cost of a PM checking in 2-4 hours a month to do a health check assessment
  - Assist with management/facilitation of Internal Elire projects

Focus Area: Managed Services

- **A major revenue stream for many of our competitors plus it would add more reliable**
  **income in spaces we already**
- Serve as a mechanism for younger, greener talent to join Elire
  - Easier to train for help desk activities rather than client—facing, delivery
  - Easier to provide support as the resources aren’t as “on the spot”
- After an appropriate period of time, these resources could transition to the core Delivery
  practices, as necessary
- Leverage Near Shore/Offshore
- Ensure we have best in class ticketing system
