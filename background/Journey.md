# The Value Stream



```
ENABLERS: Talent (people/skills)  •  Operate (tools/process/admin)

1) SELL (“Win the right work at the right price”)
   - Understand the client’s problem
   - Shape a solution we can actually deliver
   - Set price and terms we can live with

2) DELIVER (“Do the work as promised”)
   - Staff the team
   - Control changes (change orders)
   - Hit dates and quality

3) COLLECT (“Turn work into cash”)
   - Bill cleanly and on time
   - Fix invoice issues fast
   - Drive down days to cash

4) EXPAND (“Grow the relationship”)
   - Earn advocacy
   - Land follow-on work the team can deliver profitably
```

Each step has a few **small, concrete pieces of work** (think: “shape the solution,” “set the price,” “capture scope changes”) with one **clearly accountable owner**. These are the jobs where decision rights must sit.

# Misattribution (why we lose money)

- **What’s happening:** Sales-step work is landing on Delivery leaders (solution shaping, pricing, even approvals). Delivery-step work like change-order capture is inconsistent.
- **Why it matters:**
  - When Delivery shapes solutions and helps Sales price, the deal “wins”—but we lose margin later.
  - When change orders aren’t captured in Delivery, we give away free work.
  - When invoices bounce in Collect, cash slows and time goes to firefighting.

**The fix:** Put each decision back where it belongs, and measure the few dials that prove it’s working.

# The Dials (you can move these weekly)

- **Sales (SELL) dials:**
  - How long it takes to get a real solution outline approved
  - How often we discount and how long discount approvals take
- **Delivery (DELIVER) dials:**
  - How much scope we capture instead of giving away (“% of changes turned into change orders”)
  - Hitting dates (on-time delivery rate)
- **Collect (COLLECT) dials:**
  - Invoice error rate
  - Days to cash
- **Enablers:**
  - Time to fill a role
  - % of people aligned to the right skills

These dials roll up to the outcomes we care about: **win rate, sold margin, realization (did we keep the margin), on-time delivery, and DSO (cash speed).**
