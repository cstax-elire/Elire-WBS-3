# 2024 Professional Services Maturity Benchmark: A Detailed Guide

## Introduction and Core Methodology

The **2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark** is the seventeenth annual report from Service Performance Insight (SPI), a global research and consulting firm dedicated to improving productivity and profit in professional services organizations (PSOs). This report is designed to give PSOs a reliable basis to view their performance against an established benchmark of peers, providing visibility into critical business processes and key performance metrics.

This year's analysis is based on a comprehensive survey of **575 firms** conducted in the Fall of 2023, representing nearly 400,000 consultants worldwide. The report's core methodology is built upon two foundational frameworks: the Five Service Performance Pillars™ and the Professional Services Maturity Model™, which has been adopted by over 50,000 organizations.

## The Five Service Performance Pillars™

The report's entire structure is based on the premise that the success of all billable PSOs rests on five fundamental pillars. These pillars provide a logical and functional way to segment and analyze performance.

### 1. Leadership
This pillar examines the ability of PS executives to offer a clear and compelling strategy that provides a unifying focus for the organization. It encompasses the core processes of setting strategy, business planning, goal setting, and management, defining the role and charter of the service organization within the company.

### 2. Client Relationships
This area concentrates on the effectiveness of generating and closing business. It includes all aspects of marketing, lead generation, quoting, selling solutions, contract management, and partnering to win deals.

### 3. Talent
This pillar focuses on the ability to attract, hire, retain, and motivate a high-quality consulting workforce, which is the core asset in every service-driven organization. It includes the processes of recruiting, on-boarding, training, compensation, performance, and career management.

### 4. Service Execution
This area details all aspects of project delivery, from planning and resource management to project management, delivery methods, tools, time and expense capture, and collaboration. It focuses on the methodologies and processes required to effectively schedule, deploy, and measure the quality of the service delivery process.

### 5. Finance & Operations
This pillar considers the ability to manage the services P&L to generate revenue and profit. It focuses on all financial information, including revenue, margin, billing, collections, and the IT operating processes and controls required to run a predictable business.

## The Professional Services Maturity Model™

The PS Maturity Model™ is a strategic framework that categorizes PSOs into one of five levels based on their operational effectiveness. Moving to a higher level of maturity correlates directly with significant improvements in financial and operational performance.

### Level 1: Initiated ("Heroic")
- **Approximately 30% of PSOs** are at this level
- Processes are ad-hoc and fluid, and the business environment is chaotic and opportunistic
- Success depends on the competence and heroics of individuals, not on proven processes or tools
- These firms typically operate at a loss, with an average **EBITDA of -5.0%**

### Level 2: Piloted ("Functional Excellence")
- **Approximately 25% of PSOs** operate here
- Core operating processes have started to become repeatable but remain unenforced
- Best practices may exist in discrete functional areas but are not yet documented or codified for the entire firm
- Profitability is around breakeven, with an average **EBITDA of 0.3%**

### Level 3: Deployed ("Project Excellence")
- This level includes about **25% of PSOs**
- The firm has a set of standard processes and operating principles for all major pillars, though some renegades may still exist
- Project delivery methodologies are in place and enforced across the organization
- These organizations are consistently profitable, with an average **EBITDA of 13.8%**

### Level 4: Institutionalized ("Portfolio Excellence")
- **Approximately 15% of firms** achieve this level
- Management uses precise measurements, metrics, and controls to effectively manage the PSO
- Each performance pillar is supported by a detailed set of operating principles and tools, and the focus is on balancing the entire portfolio of projects
- These firms are highly profitable, with an **EBITDA of 21.3%**

### Level 5: Optimized ("Collaborative")
- The top **5% of PSOs** reach this level
- The focus is on the continual improvement of all five pillars through a disciplined, controlled process of measurement and optimization via both incremental and innovative technological changes
- These firms achieve exceptional financial results, with an average **EBITDA of 32.3%**

The report's Foreword paints a picture of a challenging year for the PS market, a significant shift after the strong rebound seen in 2021 and 2022.

#### Overall Performance Decline
Many of the most important KPIs trended downwards, indicating a tougher operating environment:

- **Year-over-Year PS Revenue Growth** fell sharply to **7.8%** in 2023, a significant drop from 10.4% in 2022 and the lowest level in the past five years

#### The Rise of AI
The major technological story of 2023 was the re-emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a true "game-changer".
