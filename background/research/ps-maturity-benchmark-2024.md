### About the Professional Service Maturity Benchmark

The Professional Services Maturity Benchmark is designed to give professional service organizations (PSOs) a
reliable basis to view their performance relative to a well-established benchmark of peers. It provides visibility
into critical business processes and key performance metrics. PSOs can easily compare their own
performance against these findings to understand, analyze and improve business outcomes.

A hallmark of this benchmark is SPI Research’s Professional Services Maturity Model, first introduced in 2008.
Adopted by more than 50,000 organizations, the model has been enriched over time by their collective
experience. The benchmark guides its users to locate their organization on this maturity model and provides
prescriptive advice to formulate practical steps to advance to the next level.

This year, 575 firms completed the survey in the Fall of 2023. Their insight adds to that of nearly 3,
participant firms over the past five years. The combined insight gives SPI Research a rich database from which
to analyze and trend.

Each year, SPI Research has expanded both the number of vertical markets and the size of organizations the
report profiles. This benchmark covers eight professional service segments:

1. IT Consulting 2.^ Management Consulting^ 3.^ PS w/in Software firms^
2. PS w/in SaaS firms 5.^ Architecture & Engineering^ 6.^ Agencies^
3. Healthcare PS 8.^ Other PS organizations^

The report categorizes key performance measurements into six organizational size segments.

```
∆ Under 10 employees ∆^10 -^30 ∆^31 -^100 ∆^101 -^300
∆ 301 - 700 ∆^ Over 700^
```

North America originally dominated the survey. Over time, the benchmark has gained significant international
participation with this year’s respondents representing leading service organizations from around the world.
Today, the Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark report is generally considered to be the global standard
for PS benchmarks.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark About**

### Introduction to the Professional Services Maturity™ Model

This report reflects SPI Research’s working premise that the business outcomes of all billable professional
services organizations are based on five fundamental Service Performance Pillars. Together they form the
foundation of this benchmark study, which explores each pillar.

Within each of the five service performance pillars, SPI Research determines the relative operational
effectiveness of each pillar with ***five maturity levels\*** as follows:

**1**

```
Initiated "Heroic": The PSO is in an early stage, so operating processes are ad hoc and fluid. The
business environment is opportunistic and primarily focused on new client acquisition and reference
building. Employees wear many hats and perform multiple roles.
```

**2**

```
Piloted "Functional Excellence": Core operating processes are repeatable but unenforced. The
company may demonstrate best practices in some functional areas or geographies, but those
practices are not documented or codified for the entire firm.
```

**3**

```
Deployed "Project Excellence": The PSO has standard processes and operating principles for all major
service performance pillars. However, renegades, holdouts, and outliers are tolerated where they
persist.
```

**4**

```
Institutionalized "Portfolio Excellence": Management uses precise measurements, metrics and
controls to effectively manage the PSO. Each performance pillar is supported by a detailed set of
operating principles, tools and measurements.
```

**5**

```
Optimized "Collaborative": The PSO focuses on continual improvement of all elements of the five
performance pillars. A disciplined, controlled process is in place to measure and optimize performance
through both incremental and innovative technological improvements. Management has established
Leadership – Examines where and how PS executives most effectively offer a clear and
compelling strategy to provide a unifying focus for organization and action.
Client Relationships – Concentrates on the effectiveness of sales, marketing, and partner
relationship development.
Talent – Focuses on recruiting, hiring, compensation and retention of people, the core asset
in every project- or service–driven organization.
Service Execution – Details all aspects of project delivery from planning through resource
management, project management, delivery methods & tools, time and expense capture,
and collaboration.
Finance & Operations – Considers the management of all financial information – revenue,
margin, billing, and collections.
```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark About**

```
both quantitative and qualitative process improvement objectives and continually revises them to
reflect changing business targets.
```

SPI Research’s maturity level surfaces areas where PSOs underperform compared to their peers.
Understanding each pillar’s relative maturity can help PS executives identify and implement improvement
strategies to move their organization forward.

### Report Organization

The report is organized by Service Performance Pillars and shows benchmark comparisons by type and size of
organization for 156 key performance measurements. It provides maturity definitions and levels for most major
business processes to demonstrate how each Service Performance Pillar can be optimized. The report offers
prescriptive guidance to help organizations advance their business process maturity and improve bottom-line
results. The purpose of the five performance pillars is to delineate core functional elements and related
business processes while providing guidance on how PSOs can move forward.

The SPI Research Professional Services Maturity Model Benchmark continues to evolve – it is not static.
Performance considered “world-class” five years ago may be considered average today. SPI Research
continually works with clients and participants to test and improve the Professional Services Maturity Model
Benchmark.

The overall benchmark highlights industry averages. But every year, the mix in the types of professional
services organizations surveyed changes. Therefore, the best way to take advantage of this report is to review
and analyze individual market figures, as well as geographic region and organization size. From there, PS
executives can determine exactly how well they are performing relative to their peers. SPI Research offers
services to help organizations score themselves and their performance improvement initiatives. Please
contact SPI Research (david.hofferberth@spiresearch.com) if you are interested in learning more.

SPI Research would like to thank everyone for their support over the past 1 7 years!
I hope this report provides important concepts and KPIs to help you navigate through the
uncertainty that lies ahead.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

### FOREWORD

For the record, ***this report was not written by ChatGPT, but it helped!\*** More on this topic later.

Service Performance Insight, LLC (SPI Research) is proud to introduce the ***seventeenth-annual Professional
Services Maturity™ Benchmark (PSMB)\***. One would think we have seen it all over these past 17 years, but each
year brings a new twist to the professional services market.

One thing hasn’t changed. SPI Research stays constant to the benchmark mission: *The goal is to provide
professional services organizations with the information needed to plan and execute performance improvement
initiatives*. SPI’s Professional Services Maturity Model is now the industry-leading performance improvement
tool used by over 50,000 service and project-oriented organizations to chart their course to service
excellence.

The Professional Services Maturity Model™ is a strategic planning and management framework that quantifies
performance relative to the performance of similar organizations. This model serves as guidance and a check
for PS executives. It is especially instructive to those executives who believe that their firm operates at a high
level when the numbers tell a different story. Numbers don't lie.

When an executive is confident in the management team’s leadership, but results show declining revenues,
dissatisfied clients, high employee attrition, and poor performance on projects with resultant lower margins
and profits, it’s time to reevaluate. The PS Maturity model serves as a basis for consideration that the
leadership team might not be as strong as they thought.

Since its inception, SPI has researched, benchmarked, and built a maturity model to give professional services
executives:

```
∆ A quantifiable understanding of how their organization compares to others similar in size and scope of
work, as well as placement within the broader professional services market.
∆ An objective, fact-based framework for performance improvement.
∆ A basis for building an annual plan that targets specific goals.
```

With this insight, executives can build consensus around actions to take, where to start, and how to quantify
the benefits of change.

Analyzing the benchmark data by vertical market, geographic region, and organization size gives PS executives
an accurate basis for comparison with their peers and the market at large. Nearly 6,500 firms have completed
SPI’s benchmarking surveys (see “About the Professional Service Maturity Benchmark” for a description of the
benchmark and the maturity model).

This year 575 firms completed the benchmark survey. Data validity and insight improves as the sample size
increases and enables SPI to expand coverage into sub-verticals and geographies. This wealth of data ensures
that the depth, breadth and accuracy of the benchmark continues to grow. The value increases as well.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

### The Professional Services Market

According to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), in 2021 there were over 40 million
people working for consulting firms based in the US. Many of those people work outside US borders (SPI
Research has not seen any update to the 2021 report). Approximately 75% of those individuals are billable,
making the professional services market an important sector in the United States as well as around the world.

Leading markets include:

```
∆ Management consultancies with over 7 million employees
∆ IT consultancies with nearly 6.5 million employees
∆ Architects and engineers with 5.7 million employees
∆ The staffing market as well as the managed services market have taken off over the past several
years. This is true of professional services organizations in both SaaS and software firms.
```

Companies in every market need the help of professional services. Technology is just one of the ways in which
they can improve performance and maximize revenue per employee.

**Professional Services Performance Trends 2019 to Present**

The past five years have been turbulent in every industry. Professional Services is no exception. 2019 was a
year of growth and success in the market. Then came 2020, with COVID and a host of problems that impacted
the global market. 2021 was a rebound year as firms truly felt they were getting back to work, but a hangover
effect from COVID lingered. 2021 saw positives in overall sales growth and profitability. However, one might say
that PSOs worked harder in 2022, but not necessarily smarter.

**Table 1 : Key Performance Metrics 5-Year Trends**

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

2023 was a year in which growth was hampered by high interest rates, uncertain economic conditions, and
geopolitical conflict, which also slowed hiring. Fortunately, Artificial Intelligence (AI) *mania* brought deep
interest to the professional services market and the firms that support it.

As shown in Table 1 , many of the most important metrics went down in 2022, and then in 2023 went down even
more! 2023 was a difficult year to navigate, which sets the market up for a rebound in 2024. SPI Research
believes interest rates will begin to go down, although not at the speed they went up in 2023. This stability
should lead to investment in every market. Professional services organizations should do very well as the
market changes and AI becomes more established. Also, because the PS market saw such a low level of
revenue growth in 2023, SPI Research expects these organizations to concentrate heavily on sales during the
coming year. In general, 2024 should be a good year for professional services, but there is always a level of
uncertainty with US elections looming.

The movement to remote service delivery appears to have peaked at around 6 5 % in 2021, or two-thirds of all
billable hours. PSOs have begun to shift some of their service delivery on site, but SPI Research doubts it will
ever reach 50%, meaning the tools and technologies available to consultancies must continue to evolve and
help improve overall productivity.

**Trends by Geographic Region**

Overall market trends are interesting, but the devil is in the detail. It is important that PS executives have
detailed information to understand how they perform relative to their peers and where they should focus their
improvement efforts. At a high level, they understand that all regions of the world are distinct with their own
characteristics.

***Revenue Growth by Geographic Region\***

Figure 1 shows reduced revenue growth in the Americas and EMEA, and APac staying flat for the year. This
chart is especially concerning in the North American region, which dominates professional services worldwide.
Inflation, interest rates and
global conflict are just a few
reasons why growth stalled
to one of its lowest levels in
a long time, but the future
will brighten as the economy
rebounds. SPI Research
expects annual revenue
growth to get back to the
10% - 12% rate it typically
achieves.

```

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

***Profitability by Geographic Region\***

EMEA again had quite a 202 3.
The region saw profitability go
from 19.5% in 2022 to 19.7%
last year. In 2023 both the
Americas and APac saw a
decline in organizational
profit, with APac showing a
significant decrease from 15%
to 9.7% last year (Figure 2).
Later in this report, SPI
Research will analyze why
profitability went down and
highlight some of the areas
where PS leaders can make
changes to improve it in the upcoming year.

Profit is not just important to pay shareholders, it is foundational to the future. Profits are used to invest in the
future by adding more training, enhancing sales processes, and placing a greater emphasis on project delivery
for PSOs.

***Attrition by Geographic Region\***

Annual employee attrition is
always important to PS
leaders. During COVID, the
professional services market
saw some of its lowest
attrition numbers ever with
employees hunkering down
for the duration of
uncertainty. As expected,
post-COVID the numbers
began to rise. The good news
is that in the Americas and
EMEA, attrition went down
during 2023 (Figure 3 ).
Unfortunately, for APac, it rose. SPI Research will always monitor employee attrition, as talent is the lifeblood
of the professional services market, and is always the first place PS leaders should work to improve.

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

***Onsite Billable Hours by Geographic Region\***

COVID changed the way many
industries look at remote work.
The professional services market
has done remote work for many
years. Consultants travel enough
already, so the use of home offices
has benefited them greatly.
Working remotely (usually at home)
means consultants can work on
several projects with several
clients each day. Remote service
delivery reached its lowest point in
2021 and has gone up since. EMEA
showed nearly 60% of consulting
work was done on site. (Figure 4) The North American market is slowly but surely increasing on site delivery and
may hit 40% in 2024.

**Trends by PS Market**

Each PS market operates differently, and Figure 5 shows just how different professional services sub-
segments are. While SPI Research did not have extensive surveys from health care professional services
organizations, the others showed just how distinct growth rates and profitability can be (The size of each of the
circles is related to the size of the organization in terms of employees).

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

***Revenue Growth by Market\***

2023 was a down market for selling professional services. As the figure shows, agencies had negative growth
rates in 2023 (Figure 6). The typically hot IT consulting market only managed 10%. Even as the impact of COVID
faded, market conditions negatively impacted these organizations and agencies.

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

Figure 7 shows a wide variety of profitability when comparing markets. Overall, profitability in 2023 was very
similar to 2022. It went up in some vertical markets but down in the two primary consultancies of IT and
management.

**What Changed From 202 2 to 202 3?**

SPI Research’s mission is to improve
performance (maturity), in professional
services organizations. Over the past year,
SPI Research has seen performance
deteriorate in several areas, most notably in
revenue and profitability (Table 2). But
performance for performance’s sake is not
enough. PS executives are charged with
making the organization succeed and
prosper. SPI Research sees four major goals
PS executives should achieve:

**_1. Revenue Growth

1. Organizational Profit
2. Client Satisfaction
3. Employee Optimization_**

Success depends on optimizing all four, not
just focusing on growth or profitability.
Firms that successfully achieve their goals have a much greater chance of longevity in the marketplace.
Without attaining each objective, chances of long-term success diminish.

**Professional Services Business Applications**

One Fortune 500 executive recently commented, “Data is the currency for innovation.” The professional
services technology landscape has expanded over the past year, with a core focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI),
process automation, and return-on-investment (ROI) for technology dollars spent. SPI Research has seen an
evolution from Business Intelligence to pure planning solutions. Not that BI is unimportant, it is just that PSOs
have realized the benefits of exceptional planning. They know they need an integrated set of tools to do it well.

A plan made in November or December is only good if the market behaves in May the way executives expected
it would when they formulated the plan. Planning is an ongoing process. Executives must be ready to reassess
their initial plans and modify them as conditions change. Everyone remembers how COVID disrupted virtually
every organization’s plan and goals. High-performing firms were prepared to make changes and were both
nimble and flexible in doing so. As a result, they achieved superior results while others failed.

The use of information tools, and in particular Project-based Enterprise Resource Planning, have given these
executives what they need to better plan, sell, hire, deliver and profit in the professional services market. The

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

standalone vendors have also done well, as many organizations still prefer best-of-breed solutions. But the
market is changing, and project-based solutions will continue to grow their customer base.

### The uncertainty of 2023 is in the rearview mirror, now it is on to 2024

The world is at the beginning of a ***technological transformation\*** in 2024. 2023 was a transitional year in every
industry, and while COVID might be behind us, some of its aftereffects continue to influence the global
economy. Inflation and interest rates rose at a faster pace than in recent memory, causing businesses to
reduce expenditures. The Professional Services market felt the effects of this slowdown and showed its
lowest annual revenue growth rate in over a decade. As a result, performance suffered, but most PSOs
maintained healthy profitability at year end. Another key factor driving investment during 2023 was the move
to implement Artificial Intelligence (AI) in every industry. Globally, companies have just begun to take
advantage of this technology, some of which has been around for decades but not in the accessible form
recently seen in the market.

SPI Research expects 2024 to be a solid year in the PS market, as well as in every other industry. Interest rates
are going down slowly, but surely, and AI will become critical to success over the next several years and
decades. This *technological transformation* is profound.

Professional services organizations will be at the center or forefront of AI as they will both implement the
technology internally to improve many aspects of their organization, and work with their client base on an AI-
centered strategy and practical ways to use it. Of course, talent and data are at the core of most industries,
especially Professional Services, and the effort made to improve both are a big part of the market’s success.

In 2023 revenue growth was the area PS executives focused on the most, but increases were inadequate. SPI
Research expects a continued focus on revenue growth in 2024. The good news is PSO's were successful in
bringing in new logo clients in 2023, which bodes well for the future.

Voluntary attrition went down in 2023, which is always positive. However, involuntary attrition went up, which
could be related to strategic change within PSOs or more likely uneven staffing levels. Regardless, PSO's should
always invest in their talent and provide employees with the tools they need to be successful. Services
delivered remotely went down slightly in 2023 and will probably reach 40% during 2024. However, this
projection might be high because PS executives and their clients are now more comfortable than ever with
employees working remotely.

**2024 Expectations**

2024 is a blank slate. With all the transitions that occurred during 2023, hopefully, PS executives can now
launch into their strategic plans to drive revenue and profit, improve client satisfaction, and optimize talent. At
the end of the year, these areas will be the ones in which PS executives will be judged most critically.

SPI Research expects a good year in 2024. This expectation assumes that key drivers will not negatively impact
industry:

```
∆ Artificial Intelligence : Will show some great use case studies in 2024 to drive further adoption but will
face scrutiny from regulators and other interested parties.
```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

```
∆ Inflation and interest rates : Should go down somewhat – not as low as in 2020 but enough to spur
investment.
∆ US elections : The wildcard for everything.
∆ Global conflict : Hopefully will slow down/end so everyone can get back to business.
```

Do industries plan to spend in 2024? SPI Research says ‘yes’ with the caveat that many companies will closely
monitor interest rates and the US elections to be held in November. Which way will they go? Every four years
the market goes through the “this is the most important election ever” phase, and how they go will determine
spending patterns in every industry.

Business applications in the professional services marketplace have hit the road running at full stride. Over the
past year, SPI Research has seen a strong movement towards planning applications, which has been a
cornerstone for professional services. Planning solutions have excelled in the marketplace due to so much
uncertainty in all industries. Always great, uncertainty amplifies the need for accurate and agile planning. In
25+ years of research on professional services organizations, SPI knows one thing remains constant: *those
organizations that meet their plans succeed in every area, from sales through hiring, delivery, and financials.*

Project based ERP solutions have been around for decades, but 2023 might have been a turning point for the
market. SPI Research has analyzed and written about the products and suppliers over the past three decades,
and last year saw an acceleration in the use of Project-based ERP. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and the cloud
helped these suppliers. Coupled with the need for greater security and integration, as well as better process
automation across PSOs, Project-based ERP became a strong preference for many organizations. Best-of-
breed solution providers also flourish offering functionality that is required. Afterall, ERP can't do everything
for everyone. SPI Research has seen leading PSA vendors grow capabilities and market share over the past
five years, as their laser focus on everything associated with resource management and service delivery has
helped their customers achieve greater productivity and profit.

### Artificial Intelligence - A Technology Thats Time Has Come

Artificial Intelligence (AI) was reintroduced as a true “game-changer” in 2023, even though it has been around
for decades. AI’s mission is extensive – to enhance visibility, growth, client and employee satisfaction,
productivity, and profit. It holds enormous potential for every industry but is especially important to the
Professional Services market. These organizations will both use AI as well as sell AI and related services to its
current and future clients. The technology has already made an impact on professional services:

```
∆ Leading solution providers for PSO's began embedding AI in their solutions several years ago to help the
professional services market with everything from planning through sales, talent acquisition and
training, service staffing and delivery to financial governance. It will only get better as time goes on.
∆ PSO's have begun to offer services to their clients around AI. Although proven in many industries, this
generation of AI is truly the beginning of the next wave of computing. SPI Research realizes AI can be
confusing and does have some negative associations. There is a good chance it will be regulated, but at
the end of the day its benefits should far outweigh its risks.

The AI strategy must align with business goals. SPI Research expects PSOs to begin their AI initiatives in a few
areas or processes to establish experience and assure it achieves the desired results. There are so many

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Foreword**

initiatives in AI going on right now from all the major software suppliers, PSOs will probably standardize on a
few technologies originally and wait for the market to mature. OpenAI will be used to build content, GitHub
Copilot for programming, and Chatbots for customer support are just a few of its early uses.

In the Professional Services market, Generative AI will be a major force in employee productivity and client
strategy initiatives. And this is just the beginning! New platforms, approaches, models, processes and support
will be enhanced by AI. AI must not only show a demonstrable Return on Investment (ROI) but must convince
skeptics that its benefits far outweigh its risk. It seems this issue always arises with new technologies. PSO
cannot afford to let fear cause them to fall behind.

SPI Research anticipates a very strong professional services market in 2024. But of course, change happens.
Leading firms will hope for the best and prepare for the worst as the market enters a critical year. AI, like cloud
computing before it, and the Internet before that, should be an exciting chapter in the technology revolution.

## 2. The Professional Services Maturity™ Model

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

### THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES MATURITY™ MODEL

### Service Performance Pillars™

SPI Research developed a model that segments
and analyzes PSOs into five distinct areas of
performance that are both logical and functional.
SPI calls the five underpinning elements ***Service
Performance Pillars™\*** because they form the
foundation for all professional services
organizations (Figure 8 ):

1. **LEADERSHIP** : ( *CEO* ) a unique view of the
   future and the role the service organization
   will play in shaping it. A clear and compelling
   strategy provides a focus for the organization
   and galvanizes action. Effective strategies
   bring together target customers, their
   business problems, and value proposition
   (how a solution solves problems differently, uniquely, or better than its competitors). For a service
   strategy to be effective, the role and charter of the service organization must be defined, embraced,
   supported, and clearly communicated throughout the company. Depending on whether the service
   strategy is to primarily support the sale of products or to drive service revenue and profit, service
   organization goals and measurements will vary. Leadership skills and competencies must mature as the
   organization matures. Culture is the unwritten customs, behaviors, and beliefs that define the “rules of the
   game” for decision-making, structure, and power. The core leadership pillar processes include setting
   strategy, business planning, goal setting, and management.
2. **CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS** : ( *Marketing and Sales* ) the ability to communicate effectively with employees,
   partners, and customers to generate and close business – to win deals. Effective client management
   involves developing a clear and compelling go-to-market strategy which defines target buyers, their
   requirements and how the solution solves those challenges in a differentiated way. This pillar
   encompasses all aspects of marketing, lead generation, quoting, and selling solutions as well as contract
   management and partnering. The core business processes performed in the client relationships pillar
   include marketing, selling, and the quote-to-cash business process.
3. **TALENT** : ( *Human Resources* ) the ability to attract, hire, retain, and motivate high-quality consulting staff.
   With changing workforce demographics, talent management has increased in importance. High-caliber
   employees represent the essence, brand, and reputation of the firm. PSOs have adopted a hybrid model of
   on, near, and off-shore staffing. This approach puts increased pressure on customer-facing staff to
   develop client relationships and more carefully define client requirements. Demands for career planning,
   skill development and flexible work options have intensified. The core talent management processes
   include recruiting, hiring, on-boarding, training, compensation, performance, and career management.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

1. **SERVICE EXECUTION** : ( *Engagement/Delivery* ) the methodologies, processes, and tools to effectively
   schedule, deploy, and measure the quality of the service delivery process. Service execution involves
   several factors including: resource management, delivering projects in a predictable and acceptable time
   frame, reducing cost while improving project quality and harvesting knowledge. Processes include
   resource management, capacity planning, project planning, quality control, knowledge management,
   methodology and tool development.
2. **FINANCE & OPERATIONS** : ( *CFO* ) the ability to manage services profit and loss — to generate revenue
   and profit while developing repeatable operating processes. The finance and operations pillar focuses on
   revenue, margin, and cost, as well as the financial, contractual. and IT operating processes and controls
   required to run a profitable and predictable business.

### Professional Services Maturity™ Model Benchmark Levels

The model is built on the same foundation as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), which has been adopted for
software development. However, it is specifically targeted toward billable PSOs that either exclusively sell and
deliver professional services or complement the sale of products with services. Figure 9 depicts maturity level
progression and outlines primary characteristics for each maturity level:

```
∆ LEVEL 1 — INITIATED “HEROIC” :
(APPROXIMATELY 30% OF PSOS) at
maturity level 1, processes are ad hoc and
fluid. The business environment is chaotic
and opportunistic, and the focus for a PSO
is primarily on new client acquisition and
reference building. Often professional
service employees at this level are
chameleons — able to provide presales
support one day and develop interfaces and
product workarounds the next. Success
depends on the competence and heroics of
people in the organization not on the use of
proven processes, methods, or tools.
Practices and procedures are informal, and
quality is based on individual experience
and aptitude. Level 1 organizations are often characterized as “reactive” and “heroic”.
∆ LEVEL 2 — PILOTED “FUNCTIONAL EXCELLENCE” : (APPROXIMATELY 25% OF PSOS) at maturity level
2, processes have started to become repeatable. Best practices may be demonstrated in discrete
functional areas or geographies, but they are not yet documented and codified for the entire
organization. Basic processes have been established for the five Professional Services Performance
Pillars, but they are not yet universally embraced. Operational excellence and best practices may be
discerned within functions but not across functions. By Level 2 individual Functional Excellence should
have emerged in key areas.
Figure 9 : Services Maturity Model Levels

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

```
∆ LEVEL 3 — DEPLOYED “PROJECT EXCELLENCE” : (APPROXIMATELY 25% OF PSOS) at maturity level 3,
the PSO has created a set of standard processes and operating principles for all major service
performance pillars, but renegades and “holdouts” may still exist. Management has established -- and
started to enforce -- financial and quality objectives on a global basis. Processes have been established
to focus on effective execution and there is a spotlight on alignment between and across functions. By
level 3 project delivery methodologies and quality measurements are in place and enforced across the
organization. Level 3 organizations should exhibit “Project Excellence” with a consistent, repeatable
project delivery methodology.
∆ LEVEL 4 — INSTITUTIONALIZED “PORTFOLIO EXCELLENCE” : (APPROXIMATELY 15% OF PSOS) at
maturity level 4, management uses precise measurements, metrics and controls, to effectively manage the
PSO. Each service performance pillar contains a detailed set of operating principles, tools and
measurements. Organizations at this level set quantitative and qualitative goals for customer acquisition,
retention, and account penetration, in addition to a complete set of financial and quality operating
controls and measurements. Processes are aligned to achieve leverage. The portfolio is balanced with a
focus on project selection and execution. Level 4 organizations should exhibit “Portfolio Excellence”.
∆ LEVEL 5 — OPTIMIZED “COLLABORATIVE” : (APPROXIMATELY 5% OF PSOS) at maturity level 5
executives focus on continual improvement of all elements of the five performance pillars. A disciplined,
controlled process is in place to measure and optimize performance through both incremental and
innovative technological improvements.
Quantitative process-improvement objectives for
the organization are established. They are
continually revised to reflect changing business
objectives and are used as criteria in managing
process improvement. Initiatives are in place to
ensure quality, cost control and client acquisition.
The rough edges between disciplines, functions,
and specialties have been smoothed to ensure
unique problems can be addressed quickly without
excessive bureaucracy or functional silos. Level 5
organizations are visionary and collaborative both
internally and with clients and external business
partners.
```

Over the past 17 - years, more than 50,000 PSOs have studied the PS Maturity Model ™ and now use the
concepts and key performance measurements to pinpoint their organization’s current maturity. They develop
improvement plans to advance lagging areas. For its clients, SPI Research summarizes individual PSO
performance in a SPIder chart (Figure 10 ). The maturity scorecard provides a measurement for each
organization in comparison to the benchmark maturity definitions and peer organizations. It provides an
invaluable tool to analyze current performance and prioritize future improvement initiatives.

This graphical depiction of the Service Performance Pillars™ by maturity level enables PS executives to
quickly scorecard their organization’s performance and diagnose areas of relative strength and weakness.

### Does Professional Services Maturity Matter?

SPI Research has spent the past 17 years benchmarking varying levels of operational control or “maturity” to
determine the characteristics and behaviors that are appropriate for PSOs based on their organizational
lifecycle stage. The primary questions SPI Research’s Professional Services Maturity Model Benchmark
addresses are:

```
∆ What are the most important focus areas for professional services organizations (PSOs) as
business processes mature?
∆ What is the optimum level of maturity or control at each phase of an organization’s lifecycle?
∆ How can diagnostic tools determine and assess the health of key business processes according to
an organization’s level of maturity?
∆ What are the key business characteristics and behaviors that spell the difference between success
and failure? How do they change depending on the maturity of the company or industry?
```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

```
∆ How does the Professional Services Maturity Model Benchmark operate within the wider context of
the technology maturity model?
```

The original concept behind
SPI Research’s Professional
Services Maturity Model was
to investigate the impact of
increasing levels of
standardization in operating
processes and management
controls on financial
performance. It is based on
the correlation of all KPIs, and
how each can and do
influence others (Figure 11).

***SPI Research’s 2024 Professional Services Maturity Benchmark demonstrates that increasing levels of
business process maturity do result in significant performance improvements. This quantifiable finding
is based on in-depth surveys of 575 service organizations over the past year.\*** Figure 12 highlights major
key performance measurements by maturity level. These numbers alone serve as reasons for PS
executives to investigate using it to increase profits.

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

An aspect that sets the Professional Services Maturity™ Model apart from others is its holistic approach to
measuring performance. ***Maturity is determined through alignment and focus both within and across
functions\***. For example, although financial measurements are of primary importance, in this model they are
equally weighted and correlated with leadership and sales and quality measurements. This weighting ensures
that organizations can improve across all dimensions, not just in terms of financial performance. However, if
the organization is profit-motivated (which most are), **increasing maturity levels do correlate strongly with
significant bottom-line profit.**

### Pillar Importance and Organizational Maturity

The results and insights gained over seventeen years confirm SPI Research’s original hypothesis that ***service
organizations must develop a balanced and holistic approach to improving all aspects of their business as
they mature\**\**\*.** SPI Research has discovered that the emphasis on individual service pillar performance shifts as
organizations mature. Excellence in only one specific service performance pillar does not create overall
organizational success – rather
***it is the appropriate balance and
alignment within and across
performance pillars, which leads to
sustainable success.\***

Table 4 depicts the relative service
performance pillar importance by
organizational maturity level. Many
professional services organizations
are established without an initial
focus on optimizing performance.
They begin with the goal of
establishing a client and reference base. They may be operated as a cost center or as an adjunct to the
product function to establish alpha and beta customers and to provide early product feedback. Initially they
often perform presales, training, quality assurance, and service delivery tasks. They hope to deliver services
that are both profitable to them as well as valued by their clients. In reality, they take the position that “just
about any deal is a good deal.”

The emphasis at **Level 1** maturity is on building client references and recruiting highly skilled generalist
consultants who are experienced enough and flexible enough to perform heroic feats to ensure early
customer success.

By **Level 2** , although the primary focus is still to create reference customers, more emphasis is placed on
human capital alignment for recruiting and ramping skilled employees, partners, and contractors. Service
execution focuses on developing repeatable project delivery methods and quality processes. At these early
stages, many embedded professional services organizations have a strong product-driven focus, and the role
of the service organization is subordinate to products. Conflicts between service profit, client success, and
driving product revenue are often characteristic of Level 2 embedded service organizations.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model**

By **Level 3** the organization must move toward a more balanced focus on all elements of the business by
investing in systems, operating processes, and repeatable methods to sustain growth and ensure quality.
Level 3 maturity should be the aspirational target of all PS organizations because it is at Level 3 that an on-
going, profitable, and sustainable business is established. At level 3 the charter of the PS organization is clear.
If it is an embedded PS organization within a product company, PS has a seat at the executive table and is
seen as adding value that transcends product implementation, integration, and customization. Increasingly,
embedded PS has become a critical component of ensuring customer adoption and may play a leading role in
driving product management direction and strategy. Independent Level 3 PSOs are financially and
operationally strong with a clear focus on target markets and sustainable, repeatable business processes and
quality controls. They have built a compelling, differentiated portfolio, which is brought to life by specialized,
knowledgeable consultants. At Level 3, heroics and firefighting are no longer the standard way of doing
business as disciplined management systems, controls and integrated systems ensure predictability and
repeatability.

At **Level 4** the organization has implemented structured business processes and utilizes integrated
information systems to assure there is “one view of the business”. Level 4 organizations are seen as true
industry leaders in their target markets. They have developed a unique and differentiated culture, which
attracts industry-leading consultants and clients. More than average firms, Level 4 organizations are very
transparent. They typically have strong management controls and visibility into all facets of the business by
providing dynamic, real-time access to
empowered team members. Level 4 organizations
continually expand their horizons and boundaries

- whether it is through geographic, vertical
  market, or technology platform expansion.

Finally, at **Level 5** the organization runs very
efficiently. The focus is on continual improvement
and innovation. Level 5 firms are the ***Best-of-the-
Best\***. They are excellent in all functional areas but
have transcended functional excellence with a
collaborative, knowledge and intellectual property
centric focus. Very few firms achieve sustained
Level 5 performance.

Figure 13 highlights some of the critical areas
PSOs should continually monitor to achieve higher
levels of maturity. And there are more, many
more! This report highlights over 155 Important
metrics to capture, analyze and improve, as well
as the tools that leading firms use to run their
business.

## 3. Survey Demographics

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

### SURVEY DEMOGRAPHICS

The Professional Services market continues to be one of the fastest growing segments of the global economy
due in large part to the fact that companies in all other vertical industries increasingly outsource and out-task
their non-core business functions, processes, and technology to specialized service providers. Today, the
global professional services industry is made up of over 25 million firms with combined annual revenues of
more than $8 trillion. It is also highly fragmented as the top 500 largest firms (each with more than 5,000
employees) account for less than 5% of that revenue. This finding has positive implications for the growth
potential of professional services firms: there is room in the market for innovative and effective newcomers
that can effectively harness skilled talent to provide specialized insights, knowledge and client outcomes.

Firms in the professional service industry provide accounting, agency (advertising and marketing),
architectural, management consulting, engineering, IT, legal, and research services. These companies
provide the knowledge and skills of their employees, typically on a project basis, where an individual or team is
responsible for the delivery of high value services to the client.

Unlike other industries, Professional Services is nearly 100% a knowledge and people-based industry. The
developed regions of North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific are rich in this resource. Growth in this segment
depends on concentrated efforts to attract and deploy skilled talent in the most proven efficient and
profitable ways to sharpen the business performance of professional services firms.

For this benchmark, SPI Research surveyed 575 billable Professional Services Organizations (PSOs) from
September through November 2023. The following sections outline the key markets which comprise the
global professional services industry and breakdown the 2023 survey demographics in several key areas
(market, organization size, and geographic region) to help PS firms compare their individual results to the
benchmark.

### The North American Professional Services Market

SPI Research uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to analyze the U.S. services
market. The primary Professional Services designation is NAICS 54xx which defines PS sub-verticals as
***“Those in this subsector engage in business processes where human capital is the major input. These
establishments provide the knowledge and skills of their employees, often on an assignment basis, where an
individual or team is responsible for the delivery of high value services to the client. The individual industries
of this subsector are defined based on the expertise, training and credentials of the services provider (Table
5 )”.\***

Headcount growth was 5.2%, down from 8.5% in 2022, and the lowest increase SPI has seen in a long time.
Issues including inflation, rate hikes and geopolitical tensions slowed growth again in 202 3. There is still
difficulty in finding and retaining talent.

In 2023, both the smallest and largest PSOs grew the fastest, and the largest firms added the most headcount
(Table 11). They also relied heavily on subcontractors to generate incremental revenue. In the high-growth
professional services world, mergers and acquisitions are increasingly seen as one of the fastest ways to
augment growth and to expand into hot new service and technology segments.

**Type of Work Sold**

SPI Research analyzed the type of work sold, (Table 13 ). In 2023, the numbers were like those of 2022.
Business and IT consulting represents over 50 % of the work sold by Embedded Services Organizations. ESOs
no longer just sell implementation, integration, and customization on either a time and materials or fixed
priced basis; now those services, just like software, are being sold “as a service”. This business model shift
heightens the need for Professional Services Automation (PSA) solutions. Providers must not only track labor
and utilization costs but also ensure those costs are within committed subscription cost levels. Additionally,
systems must now support complex multi-element contracts and billing. The percentage of managed service,
recurring revenue has risen over the past five years and now stands at 12.2% (up from 10.6% in 202 2 ).

**PSO Type**

Many of the concepts and uses of professional services described in this report also exist within product-
driven organizations. Thus, SPI Research uses the term “embedded service organization” (ESO) to describe the
rapidly expanding market for service organizations within product companies. Within professional services,
the fastest growing segment is software and IT services.

There are more than 70,000 software, hardware, IT and managed services companies in the United States;
more than 99% are small and medium-sized firms (i.e., under 500 employees). This total includes software
publishers, suppliers of custom computer programming services, computer systems design firms, and
Managed Services providers. This segment of the PS industry draws on a highly educated and skilled US-based
workforce of over 6.4 million people.

SPI Research analyzes billable PSOs in several ways with a focus on two macro segments – independents and
embedded PS organizations:

***Independent Professional Services Organizations (PSOs)\*** : Independent PSOs sell, deliver, and invoice for
professional services to external clients. Clients hire systems integrators, IT consultancies (SIs); Value-Added
Resellers (VARs) and Managed Service providers (MSPs)to implement or integrate technology based on their
strategic competence or specialized industry or product knowledge. Clients hire management consultancies
to provide strategic insight, guidance, facilitation, and coaching. Independent PSOs typically provide
expertise, knowledge, skills, and business practices that are more specialized than those found within internal
organizations. In this study a majority of the independent PSOs were IT consultancies, Systems Integrators
(SIs) or VARs, with the remainder representing Management Consultancies (MCs), Accountants, Marketing and
Advertising firms and Architects and Engineers. Healthcare services including staffing; management
consulting; technology and business process consulting represent one of the fastest growing sectors as the
healthcare industry is forced to automate and improve patient reporting. The participating PSOs represented
a broad spectrum from some of the largest independent service providers in the world to extremely small,

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

independent regional and specialty service providers. The vast majority of responding independent PSO’s are
privately held.

***Embedded Services Organizations (ESOs)\*** : ESOs operate much like PSOs; however, they are part of a
product-driven organization. The majority of ESO participants focus exclusively on their company’s own
technology but many of the largest ESOs like IBM and HP services provide global IT consulting, managed
services and outsourcing not associated with their company’s products. For the small to mid-size ESOs, their
primary charter is to successfully implement their company’s products. Increasingly the charter of embedded
PS has expanded to include client adoption with a focus on reducing time to value. While they are focused on
professional service revenue and profit, they are often asked to perform non-billable presales, proof of
concept and customer satisfaction services at little to no charge. They enable external clients but must also
support internal sales, support, and engineering constituencies. At maturity levels 1 and 2, their primary focus
is on project delivery and building a reference base.

For ESOs, lead generation, marketing and sales are primarily provided by the product sales organization.
However, as they mature, many are starting to develop their own “sales selling service” organizations. In this
survey a majority of the ESOs were part of software and cloud solution vendors (ISVs). The embedded PS
organizations in this study provide PS for some of the largest and best-known cloud vendors. Overtime the
charter for embedded cloud PS has shifted from a cost center to a profit center. Cloud PS organizations are
now measured on implementation, packaged subscription services, adoption, expansion, churn, and recurring
revenue. Almost all legacy on-premise software providers are moving to the cloud. SPI Research shows both
on-premise and SaaS results.

SPI Research uses this segmentation because independent consultancies must fund sales, marketing and
back-office operations for finance, operations, facilities, IT and recruiting in a way that embedded
organizations generally do not. Independents incur a higher cost of operation than captive (embedded)
organizations do. However, the following chapters will demonstrate independent PSOs generally outperform
their embedded counterparts because their sole focus is on delivering high-quality services at a profit.
Independents generally are focused on client delight and service revenue and profit growth, versus embedded
where the goals of delivering profitable services may be subordinate to product adoption and driving
incremental product sales.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

**Organization Size**

The average size organization in the Professional
Services Maturity™ Benchmark was 494 PS
employees, down from the 609 in 2022. This year’s
survey is based on firms that employ over 284 ,000
consultants worldwide, continuing to make it the most
comprehensive study of the Professional Service
industry. Figure 16 highlights survey distribution by PS
headcount. Each year the largest percentage of firms
have between 31 and 100 employees. Embedded
services organizations averaged 621 PS employees
whereas independents averaged 4 41. Firms
headquartered in the Americas averaged 472 ; EMEA
averaged 367 PS employees; and APac averaged 963
PS employees per firm. Software PS organizations
averaged 507 PS employees and SaaS averaged 585,
underscoring the importance of embedded PS within
these organizations. IT consultancies ( 681 employees) and management consultancies ( 127 ) also had a
substantial PS workforce. Architecture and engineering firms averaged 154 employees while agencies
(marketing and advertising) averaged 373 PS employees. Healthcare PS averaged 693 employees.

**Headquarters Location**

SPI Research encourages professional services
organizations from around the world to participate in
the benchmark survey. Survey participation from firms
headquartered outside of North America, (Europe,
Middle East, Africa ( *EMEA* ) and Asia-Pacific ( *APac* ))
represented over 2 9 % of the survey. (Figure 17 ).

It is important to note that regardless of where the
organization has its headquarters, a significant
number of employees reside outside of the
headquarters location. This distribution is especially
true for larger organizations. Therefore, the
benchmark does reflect global organizations with a
worldwide PS workforce.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

**Total Company Revenue**

Many of the ESOs are part of a larger enterprise that
also sells a variety of other products and services. As
well, many of the independent professional service
providers also sell products or the responding group is
an individual practice within a larger firm. Most
technology service organizations have multiple lines
of business which may include management
consulting, managed services, outsourcing and
staffing. Therefore, it is important to note total annual
company revenue. In this year’s survey the average
organization generated $1 53 million in total revenue
including $72.4 million in PS revenue (Figure 18 ). The
percentage of total revenue produced by PS
represented 4 7 % this year. The percentage of overall
PS revenue contribution has steadily increased over
the years, reflecting the importance of the new
“everything as a service” economy.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

**Total PS Revenue**

The global PS market is primarily comprised of firms
with less than $50 million in revenue, but SPI
Research works especially hard to survey larger
professional services providers to better
understand the dynamics impacting their business
and how they can improve organizational
performance (Figure 19 ). In 2023 the average PS
revenue was $72.4mm, with ESOs averaging
$76.3mm and independents averaging $70.7mm.
APac led the way with $141mm in PS revenue per
firm, while North America averaged $62.1mm. EMEA
averaged $77.7mm.

**Year-over-year change in PS Revenue**

For the past five years, PS annual revenue growth has averaged 9.6% (Figure 20 ). In 2020, due to COVID,
annual PS revenue growth declined to 8.7%, down
from 10.6% in 2019. In 2021 things improved with
hiring back up to 10.6%. 2022 saw a slight decline in
revenue growth (10.4%). 2023 also saw a more
significant decline in revenue growth (7.8%), setting
up a focus on sales in 2024.

Independent providers averaged 7.7% revenue
growth, whereas embedded service providers grew
at 8.0%. Firms with under 10 employees grew the
fastest at 9.1%. The professional services market
can absorb growth rates of 5% to 10% through
efficiency gains and better management of external
subcontractors, without significant increases in
hiring. However, when growth rates rise above 10%,
professional services organizations must add full-
time employees.

**Year-over-year Change in PS Headcount**

Employee headcount growth in 20 20 hit a low at 5.5%
due to COVID. In 2021 hiring grew to its highest level at
9.1%, and in 2022 came down slightly to 8.5%
Unfortunately, in 2023 headcount only grew 5.2%, the
lowest growth in over a decade (Figure 21 )!

Both embedded and independents had exactly 5.2%
employee headcount growth. APac grew the fastest,
but only at 6%. SPI found it interesting the largest firms
showed the greatest growth while the smallest firms
showed the least. 20 23 was a year of market change, as
firms in every PS market and of all sizes prepare for

1. There was just too much market volatility in
   2023, which drove more conservative hiring decisions.

Healthcare professional services grew employee
headcount 11.1%, which demonstrates the importance
of this market as the population ages and there are
more health concerns. Agencies showed a reduction in headcount of 1.3%, which doesn't typically happen in
the professional services market.

***Percentage of Employees Billable (or Chargeable)\***

SPI Research found the percentage of billable
employees decreased to 71.5% in 2023, its lowest
level in five years (Figure 22 ).

Excessive non-billable headcount creates a top-
heavy organization or is a symptom of poor sales
and marketing effectiveness and/or poor
systems. But as in all things PS, there is a delicate
balance that must be maintained. Non-billable
headcount is a necessary component of
leadership and developing infrastructure, systems
and tools which support growth, consistency, and
quality.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Survey Demographics**

**Percentage of PS Revenue Delivered by Third Parties**

A viable third-party (subcontractors) is important
to most PSOs, especially as they grow in size.
They offer additional services that might not be
core to the PSO, or additional “bodies” when there
is more work than they can manage with the
internal workforce. Every year this KPI has
averaged between 10% - 15%. Figure 23 shows the
distribution of survey responses in terms of the
amount of revenue generated by third-party
resources. The average percentage of PS revenue
generated by subcontractors was 10. 2 %, down
from 11.2% in 2022. ESOs used a third-party
workforce to generate 10. 0 % of revenue, whereas
independents reported 10.3%. APac used a third-
party workforce to generate 11. 8 % of revenue; the
Americas 10.3% and EMEA averaged 9.2%.

By vertical, Healthcare and Management
Consultancies used outside subcontractors most, generating 10.6% and 10.1% of revenues, respectively.
Agencies used outside contractors the least at 8.9%. Subcontractor use tends to grow proportionately with
organization size.

## 4. High-Performance Professional Services Organizations

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

### HIGH-PERFORMANCE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS

SPI Research annually analyzes the top 20% (in terms of overall maturity score) of PS Maturity™ benchmark
participants to uncover the reasons for their superlative performance. The focus of this chapter is on these
***High-Performance PSOs\*** (Level 4 and 5 performers). They have all performed very well, but not with targets so
high that other PSO's cannot aspire to operate like them.

In this year's benchmark, SPI Research analyzed the top 115 firms (20% of 575), according to aggregate PS
Maturity™ scores. Each of the 575 participating organizations is scored across all five service performance
pillars to determine an individual score as
well as overall maturity ranking. The
following sections highlight some of the
findings comparing the high-performance
organizations to the rest of the survey
participants.

**Demographics**

Table 18 highlights the 115 High-Performance
PSOs (HPOs). 69 % were independents while
31 % were embedded services organizations
(ESOs). IT consultancies represented 31% of
the highest performers followed by SaaS PS
at 17%.

HPOs averaged 76% more employees than
the less employees than the others, at 756 employees. They also averaged 37% more annual revenue than the
others, at $196mm, and 84% more annual PS revenue than the others, at $114mm.

**Leadership**

The leading firms tend to be highly
specialized and concentrate on specific
high-growth technology or IT segments
or vertical industries. The executives of
high-performing organizations are
seasoned professionals – often with a
track record of founding and growing
multiple prior consulting organizations.
In early-stage organizations there is a
tendency to “chase shiny objects” with
dramatic strategic shifts not necessarily
backed by analysis or investments.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

Although high performing leaders are competitive and consistently in search of new growth opportunities,
they are more balanced in their investments to ensure rapid payback with a goal of expanding recurring
revenues.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) will play a larger role in Professional Services. Table 20 highlights leaders’ opinions of
how AI will impact them going forward. They also believe their ability to use both AI and machine learning (ML)
will help increase organizational efficiency. The market is just beginning to experience the rebirth of AI. While
the technology has been around for over 30 years, 2024 should be the year where PSO's rapidly increase their
use and consulting in this exciting market.

Leaders at the HPOs foster a work
environment that is fair and well-
managed with ample rewards and career
progression. Because employees
understand and share in the success of
these organizations, the atmosphere is
one of collaboration, trust and loyalty.

Leadership is one of the most important
factors driving success in the
professional services market. In today’s
virtual work environment, maintaining a
personal connection while fostering
collaboration, “fun” and personal growth
are important leadership roles.
Increasingly leading firms are focused
on promoting from within with
investments in skill and career building
to ensure young workers stay with the firm and are continually presented with growth opportunities.

Table 21 compares the leadership metrics of the highest performing organizations with the remainder of the
survey. The highest differential score is “data-driven,” while second was in the “Goals and measurement
alignment.”

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

Some leadership principles remain constant: Leaders take on challenges that others are not able to handle,
and they invest in the future with a focus on innovation. Leaders are clear and decisive in defining their vision
of the future and their firm’s place in the universe. Strategic clarity is further cemented by abundant
communication which manifests in confidence in leadership and trust. Leading PSOs cultivate egalitarian,
non-hierarchical, flat organizations in which all
employees are invested in the success of the
firm as well as their own well-being. Their
focus on innovation means they strive to
continually stay ahead of the pack, investing in
new technologies and ideas long before they
become mainstream. Their clarity of purpose
provides a powerful foundation for their unique
cultures which support and accelerate market
differentiation, in turn leading to strong
employee confidence in the future which
fosters customer loyalty.

**Client Relationships**

SPI found it interesting the high
performers averaged over 40% of their
revenue from IT consulting. Most high-
performers firms push management
consulting with its higher bill rates. The
high performers sold about 12% more
services to new clients than the others.
2023 was somewhat of a down year in
professional services, and these firms
showed success can still be achieved
through persistence and hard work. The
high-performance firms also had more
employees dedicated to service sales,
and with a higher annual selling
requirement. Overall, their focus on
sales helped them to drive superior
results.

In this year's benchmark, high
performers generated about double the
revenue compared to the others. HPOs
usually generate more new logo client
revenue than average firms as they are continually expanding their client base. HPOs generated 33 % of their

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

revenue from new logo clients compared to 30 % for average firms. The high-performing firms were much
more productive at sales in large part because their clients are much happier and more referenceable (Table
23 ). Leaders kept a significantly larger pipeline, bigger backlog, and won more bids. Sales success does help
eliminate issues in other areas of firms, as growing PSO's tend to have happier consultants and make more
money. It is always imperative for all professional service organizations to succeed in the sales process, with
better and more targeted marketing combined with value-based selling. Client references, or more satisfied
clients, tend to go a long way in terms of driving growth, profit, and employee satisfaction. Many firms have
implemented client success programs to ensure their clients are satisfied with the work, and if not, they
rapidly work to fix it.

SPI Research found it interesting that high-performance sold a much higher percentage of Time and Materials
based work (46.3% vs. 37.6%) than the others. With consultants in short supply, there is little wonder they can
sell more T&M work.

**Talent**

Talent is central to all PSOs and is
always a hot topic. In a hyper-
competitive talent market, HPOs have
become laser-focused on their
employment brand. Organizations
embrace technology to help reinvent the
workplace with knowledge-sharing,
team building, transparency, and
collaboration at the core of their
continuous learning cultures. Support
for a virtual workforce includes use of
the best virtual tools and technologies
with an emphasis on productivity,
knowledge sharing and collaboration.

Table 24 compares Talent Pillar KPIs
between the High-Performance PSOs
and the others. Employee attrition,
whether voluntary or involuntary, went
up this year to 13.5% for HPOs compared
to 12.2% for the rest. This increase in attrition could be the result of dissatisfaction or the competition has
come in with greater packages. Two of the more significant differences between HPOs and the rest are that
high-performance firms have much higher billable utilization (75. 4 % vs. 6 7.7%) than the rest. This year, HPO
firms averaged over 150 additional billable hours per year per consultant. While they had higher fully loaded
costs than the others, the HPO firms made up for it in terms of higher billable utilization. They also did a
superior job of supporting remote employees, which reduced nonproductive time, while impacting billable
utilization very positively.

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

High-performing organizations place a premium on quality recruiting and on-boarding programs, which result
in faster recruiting and ramping times combined with higher billable utilization. They hire “A” players. They
invest a lot in them and expect a lot from them. Some create rotational assignments to give their employees
greater exposure to other technologies and clients. Employees who continually learn and expand their
knowledge base tend to stay with their employer. When the work is not challenging or interesting, morale
suffers, and attrition rises. Over the past few years, leading firms have moved to a 70% virtual environment,
but the high performers had already moved to support virtual operations long before COVID forced them. This
environment means they don’t invest in expensive facilities but keep morale high with in-person meetings and
company retreats and team building events to enhance communication.

**Service Execution**

Solid sales growth and a motivated and
talented workforce are critical to
success. However, if the firm cannot
deliver efficiently and effectively it
doesn't matter how much is sold and the
quality of the people.

Table 25 compares Service Execution
pillar metrics between the high-
performance organizations and the rest.
Quality service execution is what really
sets top performing organizations apart.
They tend to be highly disciplined in all
facets of service execution. The table
points out leaders tackling larger, more
mission-critical projects. Their projects
require more staff for longer periods of
time. Given the scale and complexity of
their projects, remarkably, they can
deliver most of them on time and on
budget. They deliver projects with
quality and integrity and are far more
likely to use a standardized delivery
methodology which results in more
projects delivered on-time, fewer
project overruns and fewer project
cancellations.

Because the best firms deploy the best
consultants and effectively use PSA solutions to exceed client expectations, every facet of their projects are

more profitable. The table also shows improvement in virtually every Service Execution pillar metric. High
performers did an excellent job of generating much more revenue per project, utilizing standard delivery
methodologies, minimizing scope creep and delivering services on time, on budget at much higher margins.
This success is what one would expect from the top performing firms.

**Finance and Operations**

High-Performers generate profit! They
are focused on financial success as a
means of growth. The Professional
Services Maturity Model™ scoring over-
weights financial success, meaning
leaders in this survey were much more
profitable than their peers.

Table 26 shows the enviable financial
results from this year’s HPOs. They had
significantly higher revenue per billable
employee as well as per overall
employee. They were much more
successful at reaching both target
revenue and margin goals. Proper
planning with talented employees and a
schedule that is met tend to drive these
figures much higher. The high
performers had a somewhat higher day
sales outstanding (DSO) but did better at
meeting forecasts, emphasizing the need for superior planning tools. Profitability for the high performers was
nearly 60% higher than the others. At 20.3%, compared to 12.7% for the others, the profitability of these
organizations goes a long way to fueling future growth. PS leaders at top performing firms always have their
eye on the bottom line.

**The High-Performance PSOs Use PS Applications**

As noted in the prior section, high performance PSO's have better information visibility than lower performing
firms. The adjacent table highlights the use of business solutions to better run the business. High-
Performance PSO's use the five core information solutions to improve their performance:

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark High-Performance PSOs**

In professional services, PSA is the core
solution to drive operational success. As
can be noted from the table nearly 90% of
HPOs use PSA, and nearly over half have it
integrated with the core financial
management solution, which gives
executives the ability to understand
project related data in real-time.

Table 27 depicts the level of commercial
business application use and integration
for top performing organizations versus
the rest. In all core business applications
categories, top performers invested more
in business applications. Because they
use these applications to run the
business, they are much more satisfied
with their application infrastructure.

In this year’s survey the HPOs had less
integration of the core business solutions
than their peers, with one notable
exception – CRM and PSA integration was
significantly higher this year. This
integration is important because the two
groups that directly interact with clients – sales and delivery – must have consistent information to coordinate
the best way to plan, sell, staff and deliver professional services. SPI Research often discusses the
importance of information integration. Visibility throughout the PSO ensures everyone is operating with the
same information to achieve organizational goals.

**High-Performance Conclusions**

The High-performing organizations in this year’s benchmark demonstrated very strong results. Each year the
KPIs change, but regardless of economic conditions, the competition, or other geopolitical issues, HPOs
figure out a way to succeed. SPI Research has worked with many of these firms to improve performance. And
like the game of golf, a great score in one year doesn’t necessarily mean a great score the next. Focus is the
key and high performers always look for improvements, utlizing information to drive superior results.

## 5. Professional Services Business Applications

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

### PROFESSIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS APPLICATIONS

Services firms are uniquely people-driven organizations. They depend on the knowledge and skills of a
talented workforce to sell, staff and deliver a range of services typically on a project or contract basis. The
fundamental financial requirements of service-based businesses are quite different from classic
manufacturing and supply-chain focused Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) applications as they must
include functionality for managing resources (people) and projects (tasks). Increasingly, project-based ERP
(PBERP) application providers added rich talent management capabilities to support recruitment, on-
boarding, compensation and rewards for the employees who are their core asset. The fact is that as
globalization continues to evolve, PS firms need the tools to help them operate more efficiently and
effectively.

Professional services organizations must, at a bare minimum, sustain initiatives to perform at the highest
level possible. However, they must also innovate in both market-facing and internal systems. Transformation
begins with building the internal excellence that is foundational to the quality of services delivered externally.
PSOs must continue to hire, train, and retain the most talented employees available, as they create innovative
services with far-reaching demand. These ongoing initiatives require that PSOs have the capital necessary to
invest and the informed ability to invest that capital wisely in areas that they can grow.

Professional Services organizations are increasingly compelled to quantify the value of the work they deliver
to justify the premium prices that fuel growth. Their mandate has become to demonstrate a quantifiable
return for work they deliver, and in foreshortened time cycles. The information tools must support the five
phases of organizational execution that SPI Research has identified as the critical success disciplines for
PSOs of all sizes:

1. ***Analysis and Business Planning\*** : Establish annual plans with the knowledge that change
   (organizational, geopolitical, etc.) can force PSOs to adapt to their unfamiliar environment without
   deterring its mission, goals and performance.
2. ***Client Acquisition\*** : Create, package, market and sell of services and products that are unique, in
   demand, and have a quantifiable value.
3. ***Talent Optimization\*** : Build a “talent portfolio” — recruit, hire, train and keep the best and brightest
   people, with both strong professional and personal skills.
4. ***Service Delivery\*** : Innovate, add quality, collaborate, maximize utilization, collect project information.
5. ***Financial Performance\*** : Assurance the organization optimizes both its inflow and outflow of capital —
   maintain healthy cash flow and margins, invoice accurately and completely, and collect in a timely
   manner.

This chapter provides PS executives and software application providers insight into the level of market
adoption, integration and satisfaction with core Professional Services business applications from this year’s
benchmark survey. The solutions highlighted in this chapter help PSOs optimize operational effectiveness
through increased visibility, streamlined business processes and cost management.

This study is not intended to be an overall application market adoption survey
and should not be relied on as such.
```

### Primary Professional Services Business Applications

The primary business applications used by Professional Services organizations include (Figure 24 ):

```
Planning (PL) / Business Intelligence (BI) : The assembly and use of information to
improve decision-making, extensively used to plan and analyze. In prior reports SPI
Research termed this application as Business Intelligence (BI), but the market has
moved to be more planning oriented.
Client Relationship Management (CRM) : The automation of client relationship processes
to improve sales and marketing efficiency and effectiveness.
Human Capital Management (HCM) : Talent management solutions for recruiting, hiring,
compensation, goal setting and career and performance management which rely on
integration with and extracts from the employee database.
Professional Services Automation (PSA) : The initiation, planning, execution, close and
control of projects and services through the management and scheduling of resources
that include people (both internal and partners), materials and equipment.
Corporate Financial Management (CFM) : The fundamental solution required to
accurately collect and report financial transactions.
```

Both embedded and independent professional
services organizations require similar functionality.
The service industry’s use of technology has
typically lagged the manufacturing sector, but the
global size, complexity and growth of today’s
service businesses has accentuated the need for
specialized applications along with an increased
demand for real-time information. Figure 25
highlights the Importance of these solutions to
optimize operations from annual planning through
the achievement of high levels of profit, what SPI
Research calls the **Plan-to-Profit (P2P)** process.

The importance of business applications
supporting the Plan-to-Profit process is that
information in one phase (for example Plan) must be

```

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

passed on to the next phase (Sell) so that the individuals responsible for marketing and sales understand what
is expected of them and can create plans and tools to sell professional services more efficiently and
effectively. Likewise, sales plans don't work well without qualified people. Therefore, information must then
be passed on to the group responsible for hiring talent, so they understand not only the skills required, but the
cost of those skills as well. This process continues as now with the optimal talent pool, PSO's can staff and
deliver projects at a price that meets both timeliness, quality *and* margin requirements. Finally, PSOs can
invoice and collect from their clients. This process is difficult enough to begin with and without the necessary
real-time information, it is extremely hard for PSOs to meet both revenue and margin requirements.

**Planning (PL) / Business Intelligence (BI)**

Planning / Business Intelligence integrates information from
core business applications to improve strategic analysis,
demand and capacity planning, budgeting, forecasting, and
financial planning. Planning (PL) and BI solutions continue to
increase adoption in PSOs, whether they are offered as stand-
along tools or part of integrated business applications for
reporting and analysis. As
professional services
organizations mature, PL/BI
becomes a more critical
tool to provide real-time visibility to all aspects of the operation — allowing
executives to spot trends and take corrective action early. It is an
important solution for annual planning, as PS executives try to uncover
areas where additional growth and profit can be extracted.

Figure 26 shows relatively low adoption levels of Planning/Business Intelligence in this year's survey. Like
prior surveys, no solution, Microsoft, other and homegrown are the most prevalent PL/BI solutions. Of the
Project-based ERP (suite) providers, NetSuite/Oracle/ Hyperion; SAP/ Business Objects, Deltek, and Workday
Adaptive Planning; each have a wide following. SPI Research found it interesting that most of the solutions in
this survey were part of a Project-based ERP suite.

**Figure 26: Planning (PL) / Business Intelligence (BI) Solution used by Firms Completing this Survey**

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

The results in Table 28 highlight some of
the core benefits organizations have
achieved that use BI solutions. While
each improvement is impressive,
growth in revenues and headcount and
size of the deal pipeline stand out. The
fact is PL/BI is a strategic tool that helps
PSOs plan, budget and forecast their
business. Its powerful “what if” analysis
tools help PSOs model capacity and
resource plans to achieve optimal
results.

Surprisingly to SPI Research, as shown
in Table 29 , PL/BI solutions are fully integrated with the core financial application by 50 % of the organizations
surveyed. Where there is no integration, it suggests those organizations are not taking advantage of the
integrated capabilities Project-based ERP offer.

**Client Relationship Management (CRM)**

CRM supports the management of client relationships and is
designed to improve sales and marketing effectiveness. CRM
automates lead, contact and campaign management, sales
pipeline, territory and contract management. Many CRM
applications also provide powerful call center functionality for
issue management; call handling; trouble ticketing and
problem resolution. CRM allows PSOs to track clients through
the engagement (bid to bill)
lifecycle, and to specifically
target customer segments
and offers by understanding details of the relationship. CRM supports
analysis by sales representative, client, geography, and portfolio. CRM is
the system of record for client contacts, relationships, and contracts.

Figure 27 shows Salesforce.com dominance once again with use by 43.1%
( 216 ) of the organizations surveyed. Microsoft moved into second place,
followed by NetSuite and Deltek. Salesforce dominance in the PS industry
is slipping somewhat from 60% market share three years ago.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

Table 31 compares organizations using
CRM to those who do not. 17 .8% of the
organizations surveyed do not use any
type of CRM solution. As the table
shows, CRM benefits organizations in
terms of growth. CRM users
experienced significantly greater
revenue and headcount growth. They
have larger sales pipelines, more
revenue from new clients and more
backlog. CRM users report larger, more
profitable projects resulting in
significantly more revenue per
consultant and employee. Improved sales effectiveness leads to a more efficient use of resources down the
line. Profitability is clearly enhanced when CRM is integrated with PSA and the CFM application.

Table 32 highlights the benefits organizations receive as they move from nonintegrated CRM to integrated
CRM with significantly pipeline and the ability to land new clients. With a stronger sales pipeline, revenue
yields soar for billable consultants because there is a predictable and steady stream of work. These benefits
underscore the importance of providing greater visibility and improved alignment between sales and service
delivery. These benefits are amplified as organizations grow.

Table 33 shows that over 65% of the organizations surveyed are satisfied with CRM. The table highlights
improvements in sales and profitability metrics as satisfaction increases. Satisfaction typically means “uses,”
as those organizations that like their solutions tend to use in more and reap its benefits.

**Human Capital Management (HCM)**

```
Human Capital
Management (HCM)
solutions (also known as
Talent Management
solutions) give employers
the tools to effectively
recruit, hire, onboard, train,
evaluate and compensate
employees. By tracking
performance, skills and
```

progression, HCM helps PSOs create and maintain a high-performance workforce.

HCM benefits PSOs by maintaining a database of skills, benefits and pay rate information that is used for
resource scheduling, recruiting and performance and career management. HCM solutions provide rich
applications that allow consultants to manage their own careers and skill development (training) and bid on
the projects of greatest interest for them. They may also include workforce management functionality for
time capture, time off and time and
attendance tracking including
workforce forecasting, budgeting and
scheduling. Employee and manager self-
service are now embedded roles in HCM
business processes. Mobile access has
become a fundamental component of
HCM to support virtual operations,
approvals and reporting. Table 34
highlights how the PSOs using HCM in
this year’s benchmark are much larger in
size, but also are growing faster and
have much higher financial KPIs as well.

Figure 28 shows that HCM continues its
growth in the Professional Services
market. Several years ago, HCM was used by less than one-third of PSOs – in 2023 it was used by 65.2%
although “none” is still near the top. HCM prevalence among the largest PSOs is significant. The average size of
the PS organization using HCM is 609 employees compared to 270 for non-users. Cloud-based solutions offer

through training to retirement, as well as reach smaller organizations.

HCM solutions, in conjunction with PSA, drive greater billable utilization, which results in higher revenue and
profit per employee. Most of the new breed of cloud-based HCM applications offer mobile access from
anywhere, making it easy for employees to keep their profiles and time-off requests up to date. Several
vendors have added rich predictive analytics, providing visibility into levels of employee engagement to
provide early warning for employees who are likely to quit. Their recruiting tools are very powerful with out-of-
the-box integration to all the top job sites.

Table 35 shows HCM benefits are amplified with better integration with the core financial management
solution. This integration drives higher billable utilization resulting in significantly higher revenue per
consultant and employee which in turn produces better net Profit (EBITDA).

```

Although HCM satisfaction lags other core PS business applications, the benefits are significant for those
organizations that fully exploit HCM to enhance recruiting, skill building and compensation (Table 36).
Increased user satisfaction is also correlated with a higher percentage of employees in billable roles, more
engaged workers who would strongly recommend their company as a great place to work, and higher
performance in both completing projects on time and meeting annual revenue goals.

**Professional Services Automation (PSA)**

***Professional Services Automation\*** provides the systems basis
for initiation, planning, resource management, scheduling,
execution, close and control of projects and services. PSA
provides a resource and project dashboard including the
demand forecast. It helps manage service delivery by
overseeing opportunities, staffing, project management, and
collaboration. PSA is typically the system of record for
resource skills, competencies and preferences with
integration to the employee and contractor database. It is used
to collect time and expense
by project and resource down to the task level, so it is the system of record
for resource utilization and project cost and estimating.

PSA solutions provide accurate time and expense capture, and most offer
billing modules with some level of revenue recognition by type of billing
method – time and materials, work in process or fixed price. PSA
extensions for the construction industry include modules for material
costs and procurement. Although PSA is still focused on enabling project-
and services-driven organizations to better plan, staff, execute and collect
all relevant information related to projects, it has become much more than

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

that. It has become a core solution for business planning with a view of the best services, best projects, best
clients, and the best people to translate the business plan into reality.

***This year adoption of a commercial PSA
decreased from 78.4% to 7 4 .3%. PSA
satisfaction went down slightly this year
from 3. 79 out of 5 to 3. 77. However,
most of the key metrics improve with
the use of PSA.\***

As the PSA market has matured, SPI
Research sees solution providers
coalescing by ecosystem. Certinia, and
Kantata are part of the Salesforce
ecosystem and AppExchange (Kantata
also offers an open application solution).
Microsoft Dynamics, Rocketlane,
Timelog and Unit4 are focused on the
Microsoft platform. NetSuite has been
owned by Oracle for several years and
years ago moved its applications to
Oracle’s Cloud Infrastructure. Workday and Deltek have created their own ecosystems.

Table 37 compares PSOs using PSA solutions to those that do not. The results in this table are very powerful.
Professional Services Automation solutions continue to drive significant operational performance benefits,
yielding higher revenue and profit for professional services organizations. The trend in the use of PSA is on the
rise due to a more virtual workforce, the need to better manage projects and resources, especially in more
technical disciplines, as it has become increasingly difficult to find, hire, retain and deploy talent. PSA
solutions help match the right resources, with the right skills at the right time to the right projects. ***PSA
solutions yield several core benefits to PSOs, but most executives only need to look to the relative10% (from
64 .6% to 71. 0 %) increase in billable utilization as a primary reason to select PSA. For a 100-person PS
organization, 6.4% translates to 12,800 more billable hours per year. With average bill rates of $200 per hour,
the PSO can produce $2.5mm in incremental revenue!\*** Almost all key metrics improve with PSA adoption. PSA
pays for itself with substantially higher consultant revenue yields, better project margins and more bottom-
line EBITDA profit.

Figure 29 shows this year Kantata as the most adopted PSA solution in the survey with 35.7% ( 200 firms) of the
survey. Certinia (rebranded from FinancialForce) was the second-most prevalent solution with 10.2% (57
firms). Deltek was third with 4.1% (23 firms). Certinia, Planview, Deltek and NetSuite won the top honors for
client satisfaction.

Because the delivery of services is where PSOs make their money, and because PSA is the primary solution
used by project managers and others responsible for services delivery, it is easy to understand why the
operational and financial benefits are so significant. SPI Research has always recommended organizations
with more than 20 employees use PSA. With the affordable cloud-based solutions now available, PSA should
also be considered by even smaller organizations.

Table 39 highlights the correlation between PSA satisfaction and performance. It is one thing to use PSA, it is
another to embrace what PSA can do for PSOs and use it to its maximum capabilities. Satisfaction comes
from seeing the benefits PSA provides, and users who are satisfied with it tend to drive better results.

**Corporate Financial Management (CFM)**

Corporate Financial
Management (CFM) [Finance
and Accounting, or ERP, is
the primary application
required to accurately
collect, invoice and report
financial transactions. CFM
collects and manages all
financial information
(expenses, invoices, etc.) to
provide management reporting and visibility into total service revenue,
cost and profitability. Project-driven, human capital intense businesses,
like professional services have unique financial management requirements
including support for complex contract types and billing arrangements and
is one reason why so many PSOs have moved to Project-based ERP.
Revenue recognition is also complex and must conform to local accounting
and taxation rules while providing support for multicurrency, multilingual transactions for global firms.
Seamless integration between the system of record (PSA) for managing resources and projects and the
financial management solution for payroll, expense management, invoicing, revenue recognition and project
accounting is critical.

Project- and service-based extensions to enterprise ERP applications started to appear in the late 1990’s at
the same time stand-alone Professional Service Automation (PSA) solutions supporting resource scheduling
and time capture and billing became available. Over the past 25 years, project accounting, resource
management and time capture and billing modules have been added to many ERP applications. Now most
project-based ERP providers also add Human Capital Management (HCM) or talent management extensions to

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

accentuate the important role that recruitment and engagement of a talented workforce has in today’s
economy.

Support for specialized billing methods and complex revenue recognition rules for subscriptions, time and
materials, work-in-process, deliverables-based or percentage completion are important project-based ERP
extensions. Architects, Engineers and Government Contractors require purchasing modules and cost-plus
accounting for materials and labor pricing as well as support for DCAA and FARS compliance. With the advent
of COVID in 2020 almost all organizations were forced to move to virtual operations, making mobile access to
financial systems mandatory. In 2021 and 2022 even more firms took advantage of virtual operations including
mobile cash management. Interviews with CFOs reveal top selection criteria for business applications include
powerful yet easy to use reporting capability with mandatory mobile access. In 2023 PSOs began to move work
back at their clients’ sites when needed, but definitely embraced remote service delivery where possible.

Every organization surveyed with over
20 employees uses a CFM solution. As
shown in Table 40 , many PSOs now use
Project-based ERP, and most are cloud-
based. Cloud-based financials provide
significant benefits compared to legacy
on-premise solutions. They make it
easier and less expensive to stay current
on new releases; they provide greater
adoption and ease of use; they provide
support for new digital capabilities
including artificial intelligence,
machine-learning and robotic process
automation; and faster introduction for
advanced billing, revenue recognition;
multi-entity; multi-lingual and multi-
currency accounting and taxation. They also provide much greater security for PSO information, which is
becoming of greater concern every year.

This year’s survey included responses from 114 QuickBooks; 84 NetSuite; 47 Deltek; 33 Xero; 28 Certinia
(FinancialForce) and 27 Sage Intacct financials clients. QuickBooks is perennially the leading financial solution
for small and medium sized PSOs with 2 0 % of survey respondents using it. QuickBooks’ market-share has not
declined despite the plethora of cost-effective low-end solutions that have come to market with the project
accounting and resource management functionality needed by PS firms (Figure 30 ).

**CRM / PSA Integration**

CRM and PSA solutions are used by both client-facing groups – sales and service delivery. It is essential these
two groups communicate and collaborate effectively. Integrated CRM and PSA help sales and service delivery
collaborate better to ensure sales are selling what the service delivery team can deliver. Table 41 shows just a
few of the benefits achieved when PSO integrate CRM and PSA. Increased backlog and much higher financial
metrics are achieved when these two solutions are integrated.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

### PS Solution Adoption

In this year’s survey, commercial adoption decreased in all the primary business applications except for
Planning / Business Intelligence (Table 42 ). SPI’s clients emphasized the importance of business and capacity
planning tools to help them navigate a challenging year. HCM usage, while down in 2023, continues an upward
trend in use as more and more firms realize the benefits of integrating payroll with recruiting and skill building.
The integration of HCM and PSA gives
employers and employees visibility to
upcoming projects and the skills they
need to be part of them. The abundance
of high quality, affordable cloud-based
solutions has enabled greater numbers
of PSOs to adopt commercial business
applications, yet a surprisingly large
number of firms still rely on antiquated
homegrown applications and
spreadsheets. Excel remains the most-
used business applications.

Cloud-based applications are outselling non-cloud by a factor of ten-to-one. Cloud solutions are especially
important in the professional services market, as today’s virtual consulting organizations may have skilled
employees located around the world, not collocated in physical offices. The cloud has enabled PS executives
and workers at all levels greater mobile access to the information they need to improve visibility and
management control of resources and projects.

CRM adoption surpassed PSA adoption several years ago, when cloud-based CRM applications, primarily from
Salesforce.com, became the standard. CRM usage is often misleading as firms may only purchase a limited
number of sales seats whereas they require PSA functionality (and licenses) for all billable members of the
organization. More firms are also investing in Marketing Automation to generate leads, track prospects and
build the brand. Corporate Performance Management applications for capacity and resource planning along
with budgeting and forecasting are becoming essential as are communication and collaboration platforms like
Slack, Jira, Microsoft Teams and Zoom (Figure 31).

Each year SPI Research’s Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark quantifies the benefits achieved by
services organizations with solutions that integrate Client Relationship Management and financial processes,
Human Capital Management and financial processes, and Professional Services Automation and financial
processes. Of course, the systems themselves are only part of a broader firm-wide commitment to behavioral
change that fosters collaboration and enhanced communication, coordination, and quality management.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

Table 43 compares business solution adoption and satisfaction along with the level of financial management
(CFM) integration. APac’s usage of CFM surpasses that of EMEA and the Americas. Recently European and Asia
Pacific headquartered firms have made big investments in PSA. HCM continues to receive the lowest overall
satisfaction ratings because SPI’s research shows much of HCM’s functionality has not been fully deployed or
adopted. Effective HCM usage requires effective talent management processes including change
management along with leadership training and development.

The level of solution adoption is much higher within embedded PS organizations. The table shows CRM, HCM,
BI/PL and PSA are significantly more prevalent in embedded service organizations than in independents, but
this is to be expected because embedded service organizations (ESOs) tend to be larger and have a strong
product-oriented sales force that is responsible for bringing services into deals. Product companies tend to
value and invest more in IT than independent service providers.

Table 44 shows higher levels of solution adoption as organizations grow. And for the most part, greater
solution integration with core financials also increases as organizations get larger. Even with the proliferation
of affordable and easy-to-use cloud solutions, the smallest organizations will always lag in their adoption
rates. SPI Research has seen adoption increase in all size organizations. This table highlights the importance
professional services organizations have placed on building a strong financial application infrastructure to
enhance visibility and management control resulting in higher productivity and profit.

Table 45 shows embedded services organizations (Software & SaaS PS) have higher adoption rates of CRM and
PSA than independents in almost all solution categories. Generally, these organizations are part of a larger
technology-focused product organization, larger organizations tend to rely more heavily on business
applications to improve performance. Architects and Engineers and Management Consultancies reported
lower levels of application usage across most categories except core financials which they rely on to run the
business.

**Application Integration with the Corporate Financial Management Solution**

While the core business solutions support individual departments in their efforts to become more productive
and profitable, when these solutions are integrated with the core financial management solution (CFM) they
create additional insight and value (Figure 32 ). For instance, CRM integrated with CFM provides sales
executives with the insight necessary to develop a pricing strategy, supporting the highest probability of
winning the bid with maximum profitability. Without this integration, it would be much more difficult to
conduct this type of analysis. Today’s PSOs simply cannot operate with functional silos as the lines between
sales, talent, delivery and finance become blurred. Table 47 shows a three-year trend on the solution’s
integration with core financials.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Business Applications**

It is also important for applications to
communicate with each other. PSA,
integrated with CRM, provides visibility
from the sales pipeline to the resource
schedule, ensuring the right resources
are available when needed. With
integrated HCM, human resources,
recruiting and resource management all
benefit from visibility into in-demand
skills, consultant preferences and
career aspirations.

Except for PSA, the table shows mixed
but improving levels of integration in
this year’s benchmark. SPI Research
believes integration between CRM, PSA and core financials is an essential ingredient in superlative
performance. Integration provides
visibility to all parts of the organization
and helps break down organizational silos.
Client satisfaction and profit achievement
in professional services requires tight
coordination between demand and supply
which can only be achieved through
integrated business applications. It is also
important for applications to
communicate with each other. PSA,
integrated with CRM, provides visibility from the sales pipeline to the resource schedule, ensuring the right
resources are available when needed. With integrated HCM, human resources, recruiting and resource
management all benefit from visibility into in-demand skills, consultant preferences and career aspirations.

### Solution Satisfaction.........................................................................................................

Table 46 shows application satisfaction
(1: very dissatisfied to 5: very satisfied).
Satisfaction with CRM tops the list
followed by PSA and BI. PSOs have
begun to exploit the functionality of
HCM more fully beyond payroll for
recruiting, learning management, career
management and skill building and
certification.

## 6. Leadership Pillar

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

### LEADERSHIP PILLAR

Leadership has been tested over the past five years. From a roaring economy, to COVID,
supply chain congestion, high inflation and interest rates, PS leaders have been tested to
navigate a variety of issues facing their firms and their clients. The leaders in SPI’s 202 4
Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark survey succeeded due to better planning and
the agility their firms showed.

Leadership is essential in every industry and is especially important in people-based
organizations like professional services. But how is leadership really measured?
Benchmarks cannot measure leadership per se but can determine leadership success by
organizational success. The 202 4 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark does just
that as it correlates leadership with success in all the other areas within PSOs.

SPI Research highlighted the leadership trends in Figure 33 because they are highly correlated with
professional services success. Unfortunately, over the past three years SPI Research has seen a deterioration
in leadership metrics, mirroring the economic uncertainty faced in every industry. With economic
uncertainty, these capabilities will be needed as PSOs navigate change.

**Figure 33 : Leadership Trends of Note**

2024 should bring political gridlock, which is typically good for the economy, along with greater supply chain
efficiency and declining interest rates. It should be a good year for most industries and especially for the
Professional Services market as continual change, coupled with the rise in AI, dictates a need for strategy and
technology services.

Each year SPI Research finds a direct correlation between growth and success in Professional Services. Given
that the PS industry is built on the application of unique knowledge and domain expertise, it is sometimes hard
to understand why the growth dynamic is so important, but it is. In professional services and the wider world
of technology, leading firms create dominant market positions. There is a compounding effect of how
customers make decisions, the networks and ecosystems that are created, and the ability to scale as a firm
that means there is a significant advantage for the companies that grow the fastest. By establishing market-

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

leading positions, premium PSOs win the best deals and turn those deals into very satisfied clients who
continue to buy and provide referrals. They become known as innovators in their markets. They produce
tangible results and harvest the knowledge gained to do an even better job the next time. They build a culture
which embodies their values which further attracts prospective consultants and clients who identify with
those attributes (Table 48).

Leadership Styles by Maturity Stage
The Entrepreneur.
Leaders are “doers”. In
small companies, PS
leaders are technically
competent and directly
perform engagement
activities in addition to
recruiting and ramping
new consultants.
Typically, they possess
stronger technical
than business or
leadership skills.
The Generalist. The
emerging PS leader
must start to focus
on HR, Finance and
Operations while
nurturing close
relationships with
clients and partners.
At this stage, setting
strategic vision and
strategy are less
important than
strong operational
management skills.
The General Manager. By the
deployed stage, the PS
leader must start to focus
on setting vision and
strategy and forging strong
partnerships with clients
and the cross-functional
leadership team. The PS
leader must exhibit strong
operational and process
management skills. He must
have a strong background in
sales, finance and
operations. The focus at this
stage is on recruiting strong
functional leaders to scale
the organization.
The Strategist. By the
institutionalized phase, the PS
leader has developed a strong
leadership team and
institutionalized operating
processes in all five service
performance pillars. His
primary focus is strategy,
business planning and
establishing strategic
partnerships and alliances. At
this stage, he must “lead”,
“inspire” and “communicate”.
He must be able to attract and
retain high quality functional
leaders.
The Leadership Team. As the
PS organization matures, the
leader becomes more
strategic and able to
effectively communicate and
inspire. All functional areas
have strong, sustainable
operating processes. His
focus is on ensuring
alignment within the
organization while continually
forging new business
partnerships. The leadership
team constantly focuses on
innovation and operational
excellence.

But growth comes at a price. The unique knowledge, vision and passion that a consulting leader brings to
founding a hot new firm must be nurtured and continuously kindled within new employees. The leader must
simultaneously learn to let go and grow at the same time. Micro-managing does not work in PS, cultivating a
reputation and repeatable skills, competencies and processes does. Most independent consulting firms can
easily grow from 20 to 50 consultants, but after that, things get more interesting. This increase is when firms
must move from heroic to repeatable and founders must move from doers and fire fighters who wear all the
hats to leaders and visionaries. The leaders who cannot make this transition must have the courage to bring in
new talent who can take the firm to the next level.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

As professional services organizations grow, leadership challenges intensify. SPI’s research into this topic
since 200 7 has shown a powerful correlation between financial success and confidence in leadership. In
smaller organizations, leadership by walking around works just fine. But as the organization grows, scope and
complexity; geographic dispersion, communication and alignment become issues. PS leaders must
implement policies to ensure communication, collaboration and alignment do not suffer with expansion.
Systems and processes must be implemented to provide real-time visibility and management control. Leaders
must be vigilant to break down silos and discourage the formation of cliques or factions which exclude diverse
thoughts and viewpoints.

### Leadership Maturity

Improvements in performance, or as SPI Research would call “maturity”, yield greater results for professional
services organizations. Effective leadership translates into a more motivated and productive workforce. It
enables organizations to grow and prosper. It also shows up in increased client satisfaction and greater
growth and profit. Everything begins with leadership and those organizations that perform at the highest
levels also have the best leaders. Figure 34 highlights how PSOs score at each level of leadership on a 5-point
scale (from 1-very ineffective to 5-very effective). While the questions are subjective, the results are not. The
best leaders achieve the highest profit. Surprisingly, as confidence in leadership grows, all other facets of the
organization improve as well.

**Figure 34 : Leadership Maturity Matters**

### The Leadership Index

It is impossible to work in a people-based industry like Professional Services and conclude that leadership
does not matter. Most intuitively understand leadership’s importance, but few studies have been able to

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

quantify its benefit. This study does just that. SPI Research developed a ***Leadership Index\*** that focuses on the
most important aspects of leadership to measure its impact. It should make sense that great or poor
leadership permeates every facet of PSO performance!

To build the Leadership Index Research asked a series of questions regarding various aspects of professional
services mission, vision, strategy and leadership including confidence, clarity and alignment. Strategic
decisions set the direction and tone for the PSO and affect all functions because vision and strategy
determine goals and objectives, the types of clients to pursue, the types of services to offer, the types of
employees who will thrive and the interrelationship between functions.

The leadership questions have evolved into nine core questions that examine how various dimensions of
leadership impact performance. The questions ask, “please rate the following aspects of your organization in
terms of how well it operates (1: very ineffective to 5: very effective)”:

1. The vision, mission and strategy of the PSO is well understood and clearly communicated.
2. Employees have confidence in PS leadership.
3. It is easy to get things done within the PS organization.
4. Goals and measurements are in alignment for the service organization.
5. Employees have confidence in the future of the PS organization.
6. The organization effectively communicates with employees.
7. The organization embraces change, it is nimble and flexible.
8. The organization focuses on innovation and can rapidly take advantage of changing market conditions.
9. The organization is focused on becoming more data driven.
   SPI Research created a “ ***Leadership Index\*** ” by ranking the aggregate leadership scores for all eight questions
   by survey participant. The minimum score for the leadership index would be nine, if the survey participant
   stated “1 – very ineffective” for each of the nine questions (a new question was added in the 2023 survey). The
   maximum would be 4 5 , if the participant stated “5 - very effective”, for each question.

It turns out the dimensions of leadership correlate highly with performance. As the leadership dimensions
improve, so do all major key performance metrics (Table 49 ). One might expect “Confidence in Leadership” and
“Confidence in the Future” to improve along with “Clarity of vision and strategy” but the truly remarkable
finding around leadership is that all the major operational metrics – revenue per person, utilization, project
margin and on-time project completion improve as well. SPI Research finds it interesting how strategic clarity
permeates all aspects of operational performance. If the strategy is clear and compelling, people-based
organizations will find a way to accomplish it.

With strong leadership, employees understand what is required of them, and can go about conducting their
daily business with confidence that their work supports corporate objectives. Strong leadership helps
employees “get on the same page,” working toward a common goal. Happy employees are more productive and
deliver higher levels of client satisfaction and profitability. The table depicts the percentage of survey
respondents by overall leadership index rating compared to key operational measurements. As shown in the
table, effective leadership has a powerful impact on all aspects of performance.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

More than any other factor, good or poor, leadership impacts all facets of the business driving stronger
growth, profits, and both client and employee satisfaction. The reverse is also true. Poor leaders can sabotage
cross-functional alignment, leading to organizational alienation, functional silos and chaos. Leaders who are

not able to transition to more
strategic roles can create heroic,
reactive organizations
characterized by firefighting,
infighting and burnout. Many high-
performance organizations have
reported adding SPI’s leadership
questions to their employee
surveys to help them measure and
quantify employee confidence in
leadership. This year, independent
firms gave higher marks across
the leadership dimensions than
embedded service organizations
particularly for clarity of vision and
ease of getting things done.

### Leadership Issues

When things go wrong, it most
often starts at the top and then
cascades downward throughout
the organization, ultimately showing up in poor financial performance. Eliminating the root causes of
dysfunction and inefficiency goes a long way toward driving organizational success. The most common
leadership issues facing PSOs include:

```
 Unclear strategy – lack of clarity around target markets, target clients and why we win. Inability to
capitalize on market opportunities due to lack of alignment, lack of employee engagement or
leadership and cultural issues. No leverage to drive repeat sales, limited competitive differentiation,
poor sales, marketing and service delivery execution.
 Lack of alignment – unclear service charters – particularly a problem for embedded service
organizations – with conflict between driving revenue and margin versus helping the overall company
achieve its objectives of market expansion and client adoption.
 Silos – exist in all companies – they usually occur in the choppy waters between groups or functions
where responsibility and accountability are blurry. A classic example... who is responsible for driving
new service revenues – is it sales or delivery? How can disconnected processes and poor handoffs be
improved?
 Reactive not proactive – because the organization lacks real-time visibility into all facets of the
business, leaders must rely on past business performance rather than being able to spot trends and

take advantage of them in real-time. Running the business by spreadsheet makes administration
overly burdensome with endless rounds of error prone manual spreadsheet inputs. Managers have no
ability to analyze and recalibrate to take advantage of changing market conditions leading to missed
targets and a demoralized workforce.
 Skills imbalance – the logical extension of organizational silos – where all parties are not aligned – not
selling what we can deliver or not being able to deliver what has been sold. Not enough or too many
people with the right skills, excessive non-billable headcount, sub-par utilization, difficulty in
recruiting, ramping, retaining and inability to staff projects quickly and easily.
 Immature processes – disparate or poor systems and tools. Inconsistent project methods, lack of tools
and intellectual property lead to low repeatability and inability to drive efficiency and reuse.
 Poor quality and client satisfaction – Failed projects, cost overruns, difficulty securing references. No
quality review processes and/or poor project visibility into budget to actuals.
 Poor financial performance – All of the above factors – lack of strategic clarity, poor alignment, silos,
and of out-of-date information contribute to reactive, rearview mirror business forecasting and
planning. The net result is revenue and margin below targets, poor forecasting accuracy,
unpredictability, and high levels of risk.
```

### Survey Results

For this year's survey, SPI Research also added questions in the Leadership Pillar designed to assess both
growth plans as well as leaders focusing on Artificial Intelligence for use internally, as well as consulting AI to
clients. The questions associated, listed below, with growth plans in 2024 are in Table 50.

∆ Forecasted revenue growth in 2024 (over 2023).
∆ Do you plan to embark on any major performance initiatives in 2024?
∆ Do you have a documented methodology for quantifying value added to your clients?
∆ Planned geographic expansion in 2024.
∆ Have you initiated Outcome-based billing models?
The responses were very telling. Anticipated growth appears to be headed north of 10% in 2024 for both
embedded and independent service organizations. The Americas had the least forecasted growth but still over
10%. As one might expect, as the PSOs grow, there is better documentation for value as well as planned
geographic expansion. Obviously, larger organizations can take on larger strategic initiatives.

SPI Research found consultancies as well as SaaS professional service organizations planned to grow the
fastest. AI should help them in this area. Both architecture and engineering firms as well as agencies show
the lowest forecasted growth, but much of that is due to economic uncertainty.

**Organizational Concerns Over the Next Year**

SPI Research asked PS leaders to rate the importance of some of the more major concerns to their
organization over the next year, with 1: very unimportant - 5: very important. They are listed below and
summarized in Table 51.

```
 Business development : create and implement new services and campaigns, find new clients, etc.
 Talent management : find, hire, train, manage and retain employees.
 Resource utilization : work to optimize skill levels, increase billable hours per consultant.
 Profitability growth : deliver more efficiently and effectively, manage cost, reduce revenue leakage.
 Inflation : manage cost increases in people, tools, travel, and other expenses.
```

As expected, both revenue growth and profits were the two top-ranked concerns for PS executives. These
top concerns were the same for embedded and independent organizations. The APac region had a higher
concern about resource utilization than growth.
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
As discussed earlier in this report, 2023 began the reemergence of Artificial Intelligence. It was probably
mentioned more often in the media in 2023 that the prior 25 years put together. SPI Research has spoken with
close to 100 PS executives over the past year and the future looks bright for AI in the Professional Services
market. As a result, in this year’s benchmark report SPI has just begun to analyze AI and its impact for PSOs.
There is a long way to go on this topic, and *every* PSO should discuss if and where they want to take AI
internally and/or externally.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

SPI asked respondents to rate the importance on Artificial Intelligence to their organization (1: very
unimportant - 5: very important) in the following three areas:

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is important to our firm going forward.
2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) is important to our clients going forward.
3. AI/ML will impact your delivery models of the future?

The results are summarized below in Table 52.

The AI numbers at a high level are similar between types of organizations in the regions, with the Americas
stating slightly lower levels of importance. SPI Research saw smaller firms to have a reduced level of
perceived importance to their firm and to their clients as well as how it will impact delivery models. What SPI
Research found interesting was in the PS submarkets. Both software and SaaS expect AI to be very important
to their organizations as well as their clients and of course it will impact delivery models. The numbers were

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

slightly lower in management and IT consultancies but still
show a higher level of importance. Some of the other
markets that aren't directly leading with AI showed lower
figures, but that is to be expected now as AI has just started
to ramp up in the marketplace.

SPI Research asked PS leaders about how well they
incorporated AI/ML to increase efficiencies? Their answers
were as follows (Table 5 3 ):

1. Do not plan to
2. Have not begun yet
3. Not very well
4. Doing alright
5. Very well

The results show PSOs are just beginning the
transformation to embedded AI in their organizations.
Leaders, as one might expect, large PSOs and both Software
and SaaS PS, are the forefront of this technology. SPI
Research plans to ask the same question in next year’s
benchmark to see how much progress has been made on AI.

SPI Research also asked which service performance pillar is the most important for adopting AI and ML. Table
54 highlights over 40% of the respondents stated the Service Execution Pillar show the highest potential
impact for adopting AI. Also, nearly one-quarter of all respondents stated that it would have a high impact in all
five of the service performance pillars. The results were close across embedded versus independent
professional services organizations and SPI Research found that in APac both the Leadership and Talent
pillars were not considered at all.

**Goal Focus**

The improvement of performance is important, but PS executives must always keep their eye on the prize —
the achievement of organizational goals. For the first time in the 17 - year history of the Professional Services
Maturity™ Benchmark SPI Research asked leaders which goals they were most focused on for the coming
year. The results surprised SPI Research as it expected a more concentrated effort on talent. However, with
major changes in the technology market, there appear to be more available consultants than in past years. PS
executives show over 35% of their efforts will be focused on revenue growth, followed by profitability
improvement.

The results were consistent across PSO types, geographic regions, markets and organization size (Tables 54 -
56 ). Every year PS executives face new challenges, and in the short term it will be sales.

**Leadership Trends and Results**

The following tables highlight the past five years of benchmark surveys. While typically there are not large
changes at a high level, individual markets are at different phases of change, demand, talent and capital. The
leadership results declined from 2022 to 2023, which makes it two years in a row leadership KPIs have gone
down. 2023 was a difficult year for many firms as their clients reduced consulting costs. 2024 will be another
interesting year with the economy recovering and the US elections will cause more uncertainty.

Overall, management consultancies scored very high in the leadership KPI's. Architecture and engineering
firms scored lower than average. Smaller firms tend to score higher on Leadership KPI's than the larger firms.
The reasoning behind the higher scores most likely has to do with a small number of people being better able
to communicate and collaborate across the organization. Also, they tend to work in an environment where
being nimble is critical. Larger firms tend to have more structured processes and have greater levels of
bureaucracy. But the larger firms typically have more stability and the ability to take their time to make sure
they make the right decision.

**There is a Well Understood Vision, Mission and Strategy**

Clear leadership direction and effective bi-directional communication are critical success factors. Employees
who lack an understanding of the vision, mission and strategy have no ability to work toward realizing it
whereas those who comprehend and support the organization’s mission will work tirelessly to realize it. In this
year’s survey, clarity of vision, mission and strategy directly correlated with revenue and headcount growth, on
time service delivery, propensity to recommend as a great place to work and revenue per consultant and
employee (Table 62).

**Employees have Confidence in PS Leadership**

The tools for effective leadership, clarity of purpose and alignment exist within all service organizations. By
investing in these critical aspects, PSOs can manage their own destiny. SPI Research continues to discover
most key performance measurements improve as confidence in leadership increases. According to survey
results, a few other factors have the same impact on the overall health and well-being of the service PSO.

Poor leadership creates a negative spiral effect — high attrition, low morale, poor employee engagement —
which in turn lead to low levels of client satisfaction and poor financial results. Leadership plays a critical role
in growth. As millennials become dominant in the workforce, effective leadership is more critical than ever
before. Younger workers need more guidance, handholding, and constructive feedback to hone both their
technical and interpersonal skills.

As shown in Table 63 a key aspect of confidence in leadership is based on clarifying the growth strategy which
translates to pursuing the right opportunities and having the right resources to effectively deliver. Alignment
leads to success, cementing the firm’s value proposition.

**The Ease of Getting Things Done**

The ease with which work gets done directly impacts productivity and morale. SPI Research asked
participants whether it was easy to get things done within their organization, meaning minimal red tape, able
to assign qualified resources quickly and easily, and with limited bureaucracy. PSOs that provide an
infrastructure that supports employee productivity enhance both employee satisfaction and financial
success. Table 64 shows most firms reported it is relatively easy to get things done. As ease of getting things
done improves, less overhead is needed and PSOs operate more efficiently, leading to higher margins and
profit.

**PS Goals and Measurement Alignment**
Alignment speaks to a clearly articulated strategy with goals and measurements reinforcing the organization’s
purpose and stimulating action. Alignment or lack thereof has a significant impact on bottom-line
performance. Lack of alignment emanates from a lack of clarity and conflict or too many priorities. It is
characterized by low levels of employee engagement and functional silos or factions. The highest performing
service organizations exhibit clarity of purpose and alignment around a succinct set of core values and
initiatives. Effective measurements and compensation reinforce those values, linking strategy to execution

**Employees Have Confidence in PSO's Future**

The level of employee confidence in the future of the PS organization has a significant impact on almost every
key performance measurement. Firms with the highest levels of employee confidence experienced the
highest levels of revenue growth, were more often seen as a great place to work, and experienced lower
attrition and higher utilization (Table 66). To cap it all off, they were also more profitable.

“The world loves a winner” seems to be an appropriate description for the positive results of the organizations
with the highest levels of employee confidence. A key “chicken or egg question” always arises around
“confidence in the future” as typically the highest performing and fastest growing organizations propel
employees to have confidence in the future, while low confidence is indicative of organizations in turmoil or
going through massive change as they reposition themselves to take better advantage of the future. A key
consideration for firms that experience low to no growth is how to reposition themselves onto a growth path
while maintaining employee commitment.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Leadership Pillar**

Organizational communication helps align organizations to achieve common goals and objectives. It becomes
increasingly difficult as the PSO grows and expands into new geographies. Respondents were asked to rate
how effectively the organization communicates with employees. Talk may be cheap but without bidirectional
communication, employees quickly become disenfranchised. The creation of an effective communication
plan should be part of any improvement plan. Poor or no communication has a profound impact on marketing
and sales and service delivery (Table 67). Low project margins are exacerbated by poor communication.

**Embraces Change – PS is Nimble and Flexible**

Change is never easy, and most people and organizations have a difficult time with it. One of the primary
reasons why more and more companies out-task IT, accounting, law, architecture, strategy and marketing to
specialized PS organizations is that the pace and amount of change and technical complexity is impossible to
keep up with, so they must reply on external consultants and specialists. Each leadership dimension impacts
all other leadership dimensions. Nimble organizations that can easily adapt to change, have higher levels of
billable employees and are considered better places to work (Table 68). The survey shows nimbleness and
adaptability diminish as organizations grow. But these organizations do expand their client base and win more
bids as the embrace change. They also show better service delivery and project profitability as they embrace
change and are especially nimble and flexible.

**Leadership is Innovation Focused**

Innovation is critical to the long-term growth and success of PSOs. Firms that create new services, and
products in many cases, have a growth path built for them. In professional services, innovation comes from
exploring and embracing new business models, processes, and technologies to improve productivity and
quality. To the extent thought leadership can be considered a component of innovation, PSOs excel at
innovation. The benchmark results depict the importance of striving for new and innovative solutions to
problems. Innovative organizations provide employees with the confidence to know the organization will be
around for years to come, and they will be continually challenged and personally grow as the organization
expands (Table 69). Innovation focus is not organization size dependent. High-Performance PSOs report a
core belief in “great ideas come from anywhere”. They build a culture of empowerment, embracing innovation.

Any employee with a great idea, at any level, can build a business case and receive funding and support to
tackle internal problems or create new solutions. Approximately 60% of survey participants gave high marks
for innovation. With innovation, revenues grow, and clients are pleased. Those that did grew much faster and
made much more money than those with lower levels of innovation. They also had greater engagement from
their workforce, coupled with greater efficiency.

**Professional Services is Data-driven**

Businesses in every industry are moving to take a more data-driven approach to operations. It is no different
in the professional services market. Over the past 25 years SPI Research has seen leaders in the PS market
adopt technology to better plan and run their businesses. But the data must not be kept in silos, it must be
shared across the organization to ensure each decision maker has the information necessary to make
changes to improve performance.

Table 70 shows PSOs with a stronger data focus succeed in both revenue growth and the achievement of
significantly higher revenue. As one might expect, those organizations with a strong data focus run more
efficiently than those that do not. The results show up also in greater financial achievement. SPI Research
expects this issue to become increasingly important as PSOs use data and AI to drive better business results.

## 7. Client Relationships Pillar

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

### CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS PILLAR

The Client Relationships pillar focuses on the activities associated with business
development and client management. PSOs spend significant time and capital to find and
retain clients, which is a primary means of growing a business and is always one of the
top challenges for PS firms.

Cultivating new and repeat clients is the lifeblood of the service industry. Professional
services organizations are in business to provide knowledge, expertise and guidance.
Their sales and marketing organizations must define target markets and solutions by
understanding key client challenges. The job of service sales and marketing is to
generate awareness and identify and close opportunities. Services are intangible, so
service sales and marketing must demonstrate concrete proof of the firm’s knowledge,
experience, differentiation and quality.

**Figure 35 : Client Relationships Trends of Note**

***Source: SPI Research, February 2024\***
SPI Research highlighted three of the client relationships trends in Figure 35 because they are some of the
most important KPIs for the Client Relationships pillar. While the good news is the PSOs in this study had over
30% of their clients being new, both their deal pipeline and the backlog went down again in 2023. SPI Research
believes the deal pipeline should be over 200% of the quarterly bookings forecast and the backlog should be
over 50% at the beginning of each quarter. The trends of these two KPIs should be monitored to avoid further
deterioration.

In 2023 most of the Client Relationships KPI's went down. SPI Research expects a major effort in 2024 to grow
revenue. While the KPI's went down, they weren't much lower than the prior year. 2023 was a year of
uncertainty, especially with inflation, interest rates and AI taking center stage. Now, things have begun to
settle down and PSOs can get back to selling.

Table 71 describes the five levels of maturity in the Client Relationships pillar. As sales and service delivery
processes mature, organizations move from selling anything and everything to anyone, to a more careful and
selective approach to client selection, solution creation, deal capture, contract and pricing management,
reference building and partnering.

The effectiveness of the organization’s sales and marketing efforts determines the quality and size of the
pipeline; win ratios; discounts; client satisfaction and referenceability and the length of the sales cycle.
Effective sales and marketing organizations continually uncover new opportunities while ensuring existing
customers continue to buy and refer. Today’s successful PSO, whether embedded or independent, is
increasingly taking charge of its own destiny by investing in sales, marketing and service packaging.

### Client Relationships Maturity Model™

Improvements in sales and marketing performance, or as SPI Research calls it, “maturity”, yield fantastic
results for professional services organizations. Effective client relationships translate into greater growth as
PSOs increase deal pipelines, win more bids, and build backlog. With robust sales and market demand, PSOs
can be more selective around the deals they pursue and the types of clients they serve. They become adept at
pushing back on lousy terms and conditions or excessive discounting which puts the firm at risk while
minimizing profit. In the new virtual sales and delivery world, prospective clients in all industries are
scrambling to select and implement cloud-based business applications. Every industry has had to shift to on-
line self-service applications which has created robust demand for IT and management consultancies. Figure
36 shows the powerful results as PSOs improve their sales, marketing, service packaging and client reference-
building programs.

Improving client relationship maturity produces significant advantages in terms of market expansion (a higher
percentage of new logo client revenue); win ratios; size of the sales pipeline and reductions in discounting.
More mature organizations report significantly better client referenceability and net promoter scores which in
turn lead to referrals, more clients and larger projects. More mature PSOs need fewer salespeople but with
much higher sales quotas and win ratios. Improved sales effectiveness not only costs less in direct sales and
marketing costs but also produces much better results with higher realized bill rates and lower discounts.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

High-performing organizations understand sales and marketing effectiveness is not achieved in isolation; it is
the combination and alignment between strategy, marketing, sales and service delivery, which makes the
difference. Leading organizations are aligned from strategy to execution with all elements of the business
working in concert to delight clients.

**Figure 37 : Bill Type of Work Sold by Maturity Level**

```

```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

An examination of the type of work sold (Figure 37 ) shows high-performing firms sell more time and materials
work as the market for professional services expands, and talent becomes harder to find. The pendulum
continues to swing toward more power in the hands of PSOs, which should lead to higher bill rates and profits
going forward. In this benchmark, firms that primarily use time and materials pricing are significantly more
profitable than those that favor fixed pricing.

In today’s incredibly tight talent market firms assume more risk with fixed pricing as they may not be able to
find the resources they need to deliver on time. More service providers now offer subscription and “managed
services” as monthly, quarterly or annual contracts to drive more predictable, recurring revenue. Buyers want
predetermined monthly costs, putting the onus on service providers to correctly package, price and deliver
contracts. Shared risk contracts are gaining steam, but still have a long way to go to being a preferred method
of use.

### 5 - Year Client Relationships Trends

Table 72 highlights the past five years of benchmark surveys. The table shows most Client Relationship
metrics achieved their highest performance in 2021. The market started becoming healthier in 2021 and 2022
as PSOs learned how to market and sell during the pandemic while consulting demand skyrocketed. However,
in 2023 the market took a step back due to so much economic uncertainty. Now, the biggest concerns
amount to a smaller deal pipeline, a lower percentage of bids won, and increased discounts. The results show
slower growth and the lowest client reference scores in over five years.

**Size of the Deal Pipeline in Comparison to the Quarterly Bookings Forecast**

```
The size of the pipeline (in dollars) is divided by the forecasted revenue. Only include the pipeline revenue
for the quarter for those potential engagements that span multiple quarters.
```

The size of the deal pipeline shows a direct correlation to all major growth indicators – revenue growth; new,
clients, backlog, revenue per billable employee; percentage achievement of annual revenue and margin
targets and billable utilization.

A sign of caution and continued market turbulence is that 58.2% of benchmark participants reported their
deal pipeline was less than two times the size of their forecast. Table 76 illustrates the positive impact of a
strong sales pipeline on revenue growth; backlog; billable utilization and real-time visibility.

Table 77 shows the average size of the deal pipeline went down to 1 54 % after being 162 % in 202 2. ESOs
reported lower pipelines of 161 % of forecast while independents also reported leaner pipelines of 152 %. EMEA
had the lowest (1 38 %) deal pipeline relative to quarterly bookings forecast in 2023. SPI Research will wait to
see if this decrease becomes a trend, or just a one-year reduction in pipeline as the market adjusts.

**Percentage of Bids Won**

```
The percentage of client bids submitted that are awarded with contracts.
```

The percentage of bids won is a culmination of good marketing, sales and pricing. If the percentage of bids
won is too high, it may be an indication that the organization is not aggressive enough in targeting new clients
and new services (Table 78). If it is extremely low, it is an indication the firm is competing in a commoditized
market or is not well-positioned or is not doing a good job of qualifying deals. The best deals are those that do
not require a bid (sole source) because the client has done business with the firm before and knows they will
do a good job, or they are so clearly the premium supplier that no other providers need be considered.

The percentage of bids won went down to 48.1% from 50.2% the year earlier. Table 79 shows the positive
impact of an improving percentage of bids won through higher revenue growth, greater backlog and improved
client references and on-time service delivery. This year the optimal percentage is over 80% with the highest

**Quarterly Revenue Target in Backlog**

```
Quarterly revenue backlog is the amount of already sold (booked) business in backlog (ready to execute)
divided by forecasted quarterly revenue.
```

Backlog represents “fuel in the tank,” it improves an organization’s ability to grow and increases the accuracy
of financial forecasts. Some PSOs measure quarterly backlog as the amount of already sold work plus the
amount of work from a factored sales forecast.

Declining backlog is a clear indication of slowing growth. Backlog is one of the most powerful leading
indicators. Product-focused organizations have more problems with backlog as they frequently sell a “bank of
hours” with the product sale, which may never be consumed. It is a good idea to frequently “scrub” backlog to
determine whether booked deals can be delivered in the current quarter. If they cannot, this “shadow” backlog
should not be counted. Typically, if backlog is not consumed (delivered) within a year it should be written off or
removed from the revenue forecast as it is unlikely the client will use the consulting time they have been sold.

Table 80 shows how other key performance indicators change as PSOs increase their backlog. Backlog is
driven by a larger pipeline and higher win ratios. Part of this success is driven by an increase in new clients,
but also by PSOs performing well, as evidenced by the achievement of annual revenue and margin goals.

Overall, backlog went down slightly, but in embedded services organizations it went down by 6 %. It also went
down in IT consultancies but did much better in Software PS, Agencies and Healthcare PS (Table 81). The
larger firms did the best, increasing backlog while the smaller firms decreased it slightly.

**Service Discount Given Clients**

```
The average discount or price concession from list price for a proposed service.
```

The average discount percentage highlights how much off the standard price the organization must discount
its services to win bids. This percentage is very important as it cuts right into PS margins. Professional
services organizations build, sometimes elaborate, pricing models to optimize revenue and profitability. As

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

competition heats up in services, differentiation is not enough to win the bid, and PS executives must
discount their services.

In professional services, it is far more difficult to develop a pricing strategy than in product-based
organizations. It is easy to do comparative shopping at a grocery store or for products on-line. In professional
services, pricing is more art than science with wider variability in terms of costs, estimates, proposals and
pricing. Professional services executives cannot just look at expected project cost, sales forecasts, or some
other key metric to set pricing. Supply and demand come into play. The more unique the offering; the more
demonstrable the return on investment; the larger the reference base; the harder it is to find the required
skills; the more premium pricing is warranted. Table 82 shows over 70 % of organizations discount less than
10%. Those organizations that discount heavily (greater than 20%) have significantly higher employee attrition
and much lower client references.

```

Past win percentages are critical but must be viewed in conjunction with past and projected project margins
to determine the optimal pricing strategy. Professional services executives should not mind losing bids when
they hurt margin because “bargain basement” pricing rarely results in win-win partnerships. If firms are
continually asked to discount pricing it is a sure sign that something is wrong. Either they have not properly
demonstrated their value, or they are moving into a commodity market, or they have not done a good job of
differentiating their services. There are no way service organizations can make up in volume the amount they
lose per deal because margins are too thin and there is no way to recoup hours worked at cheap rates.

Although limiting discounting might impact growth, it enhances win ratios, billable utilization, on-time project
delivery and client references. Firms that refrain from discounting do a better job of using standardized
methods and tools, resulting in fewer project overruns. Profit is the fuel that drives expansion. While not every
project achieves its desired profitability goal, one or two money-losing projects can quickly undermine all
profit.

When creating a large bid, all costs including sales costs should be measured. Very few projects are delivered
precisely on time and on budget, so change control is an important element of pricing. If a client demands
pricing concessions, scope must be contained, but the client must also understand and accept the risks. Best

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

practices in pricing include creating a dedicated proposal center to ensure all proposals are of the highest
quality. Bid, estimate, pricing and contract reviews are all good investments which pay dividends by improving
project margins and reducing the risk of overruns and losses. Table 83 shows increases in discounting across
the survey. Ideally, there would be no discounting, but most firms must discount occasionally.

**Percentage of Referenceable Clients**

```
The percentage of customers who would provide a reference to help the PSO sell more services. Ideally this
KPI would be captured from an outside service.
```

The percentage of reference clients is considered one of the most important KPIs in the professional services
market. Client references have a strong correlation with service sales effectiveness; the length of the sales
cycle; ease of getting things done and whether employees would recommend the PSO as a great place to
work. The relationship between client and employee satisfaction is irrefutable.

Client references are a leading indicator of organizational success. As the percentage increases, so does the
probability of high levels of growth, better win ratios and lower sales costs. Any maturity improvement plan
must address measuring and improving client satisfaction and building references. Best practices include
post-project engagement interviews and surveys, acquiring client references and testimonials as part of
project close-out process along with frequent and consistent project quality reviews. Executive teams should
review the project dashboard at weekly meetings and immediately assign resources to intervene with troubled
projects. Table 84 shows higher references yield higher sales win rates and revenue per consultant and
employee. Referenceable clients also help PSOs meet revenue and margin targets.

**Primary Strategy for Growth**

2023 was a more difficult year than normal for selling professional services. PS leaders continue to develop
new ways to sell and new services to drive revenue growth. For the first time, SPI Research asked PS
executives what their primary strategy for growth would be in 2024. These strategies include:

```
∆ Mergers & Acquisitions
∆ New services offerings
∆ Adding headcount
```

Table 86 shows most firms have multiple strategies to add headcount, offer new services and become
involved with M&A activity. Smaller firms were very focused on adding new services, whereas IT consultants
and AE firms look to add headcount.

**Effectiveness of Service Development, Marketing and Sales Processes**

```
The effectiveness of solution development, service marketing, and sales on a 1-5 scale,
with 1=very ineffective and 5=very effective.
```

To successfully create, market and sell professional services, PSOs must go through a process of analyzing
market trends, past and future services commitments and understanding client needs and translating them
into solutions. The following sections analyze how effective PSOs are in solution development, marketing and
sales.

***Solution Development Effectiveness\***

Solution development effectiveness requires consistent PS and Sales executive funding and support. Ad hoc
teams of benched consultants cannot be effective in developing a compelling and meaningful solution
development strategy and program. Based on the Service Lifecycle Management Maturity Model™ Benchmark,
very few organizations are effective at service productization. Creating an effective and efficient solution
development process is a difficult undertaking. Most firms are struggling to do this because solution
development crosses over traditional functional boundaries and requires cross-organizational collaboration
and change management. The work of having all the constituent groups – professional services, sales,
marketing, product management and channel partners – on the same page to create compelling solutions for
targeted markets is a tough but worthwhile task.

Solution development requires significant leadership, organizational commitment, funding and on-going
change management. SPI Research believes that the following are critical success factors for instantiating
and sustaining a successful solution development program:

```
∆ Articulated and well-understood services strategy
∆ Service productization program vision
∆ Executive sponsorship
∆ Market-driven focus
∆ Global company adoption of program
∆ On-going resource commitment
∆ Cross-functional participation; and
∆ Repeatable sales and delivery methods, tools, and templates.
```

SPI Research asked how effective solution development was on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing very
effective (Table 87 ). Solution Development effectiveness has traditionally been given a lower score than sales
effectiveness but higher marks than marketing effectiveness. This year’s overall solution development
effectiveness was rated higher than sales effectiveness with a score of 3.6 2 compared to 3. 54 for sales
effectiveness and 3. 15 for marketing effectiveness. All the measures of solution development, sales and
marketing effectiveness decreased from the 202 2 survey. For 58.1% of firms who gave their solution
development efforts a good score of 4 or 5, solution development had a positive impact on the size of the
percentage of bids won, project overrun and meeting annual revenue and margin goals.

***Service Marketing Effectiveness\***

Service Marketing must develop an effective online presence, thought leadership, lead generation campaigns,
sales tools and sales enablement to amplify the firm’s brand awareness and to showcase thought leadership
while nurturing qualified leads. The most successful PS marketing efforts require a strategic focus to ensure
they augment and enhance the firm’s strategy.

Marketing should be charged with bringing the firm’s vision and strategy to life through effective positioning.
Without a seat at the executive table, marketing will be relegated to tactical lead generation and sales support

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

activities. Effective marketing requires dedicated, skilled personnel along with sustained funding which
supports on-going campaigns.

SPI Research asked how effective service marketing was on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 representing very
effective (Table 89 ). Marketing effectiveness has consistently been given an even lower score than sales
effectiveness. For 38.3% of firms that gave their marketing efforts a strong score of 4 or 5, marketing has a
positive impact on revenue growth, size of the sales pipeline, and project margins. Marketing is certainly
worth the expense if it is well-staffed, fully funded and strategically positioned.

***Service Sales Effectiveness\***

SPI Research asked respondents to rank the effectiveness of the service sales organization on a scale from 1
to 5 with 5 representing very effective (Table 91 ). Sales effectiveness has a profound impact on all aspects of
PS but unfortunately 12.3% of respondents give sales effectiveness a failing grade of 1 or 2; 30.2% give sales
effectiveness an “OK” score of 3; but 57.6% gave sales effectiveness high marks. This year’s average rating of
sales effectiveness decreased from 3.60 (72.0%) to 3.54%.

**Efficiency of Quoting Service Engagements**

PSO's not only work to generate quotes that are accurate and provide sufficient margins, they also work to
become more efficient in the process. This process continually creates additional time and cost, and if not
done so in a timely manner the PSO will not win the bid. Table 93 highlights approximately 50% of the
organizations surveyed did an effective job of being efficient in the quoting process. The results show higher
revenue growth and on-time delivery. Success in the quoting phase helps drive financial results.

**The Technology Infrastructure Supports Growth**

The SPI Research principals have spent over 25 years analyzing technology in the Professional Services
market. CRM solutions have been around for decades, but PSOs that have integrated it with PSA have
generally delivered superior results. SPI Research asked this year for the first time “does the technology
infrastructure of the organization support growth of the firm?” The results highlighted in Table 94 show over
50% of the responses believe the technology infrastructure does support growth. The results are impressive
in terms of helping the organization not only grow revenue, but also build pipeline and win more bids.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

**Pricing and Deal Structure**

```
Pricing structure refers to the percentage of work sold by deal structure: time and materials; fixed fee;
performance-based; subscription; managed services or other.
```

SPI Research has seen a shift in pricing and deal structure every year. As clients have become increasingly
concerned about risk and cost overruns, they have pushed for more accountability to PSOs through fixed fee
and shared risk contracts. Until 2014 the percentage of fixed fee work steadily increased from 35.5% in 2009
to 44.7% in 20 22. In 2023 it was 36.5% and 48.1% of all contracts were priced as time and materials.

Managed service contracts bundle hardware, software, services and technology refresh into a monthly or
annual contract price, often with response time and service level agreements. Time and materials-based
pricing puts emphasis on accurate resource management, time collection and reporting. Fixed price pricing
puts an emphasis on accurate estimates, project costing and change management. Regardless of pricing
strategy, PSA and now new service CPQ (Configuration, Pricing and Quoting) applications are critical to
support accurate estimates and time and cost capture and billing.

Table 95 compares billing models for embedded and independent PSOs. ESOs have been steadily shifting away
from fixed fee contracts in favor of subscription and managed service pricing. Independents have always
preferred time and materials contracts; with increased demand, they are moving away from fixed price work
due to the cost and time overruns which are inherent in fixed price contracts. By geography, time and
materials are the prevalent pricing structure. EMEA predominantly sells time and materials contracts although
they are often “daily” contracts which are far less favorable for the service provider than hourly contracts.

**Table 95 : Percentage of Work Sold**

```

```

By vertical, architects, agencies and consultancies rely on fixed price contracts approximately 45 % of the
time (Table 96 ). IT consultancies favor time and materials contracts. As the SaaS market has become more
mature a greater emphasis is being placed on customer adoption, so SaaS firms focus on “time to value” with
subscription pricing which includes the cost of software and implementation services. Net profit is not
necessarily tied to pricing structure as it is possible to make good service margins with any type of contract if
costs, deliverables and client expectations are properly set. Accurate estimating, excellent project

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

management, good communication and change control are the most important elements in ensuring quality
services are delivered at planned margins.

**Other Client Relationships KPIs**

SPI Research reintroduced several questions not asked recently but given some of the difficulties in growing
revenue in 2023, SPI felt it was important to ask these questions again. SPI found many firms did not know the
meaning of Net Promoter Score (NPS). Fortunately, enough understood its meaning in that it can go from - 100
to +100.

SPI also wanted to know how many full-time equivalent (FTE) employees were dedicated to service sales in the
PS organization, as well as what their annual service sales revenue quota was, the deal size of the contract,
and how long it took from qualified lead to signing of a contract. The information is summarized in the
following three tables (Table 9 8 – 100). SPI found interesting the uniformity of the NPS across the survey, PS
types and regions. Software and SaaS organizations tend to capture Net Promoter Scores more often than the
other markets and their scores were also lower than the other markets. Not as much is known about this area
yet within the professional services make to make any concrete analysis. In terms of full-time employees

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Client Relationships Pillar**

dedicated to service sales, management consultants had very few relative to software and SaaS firms. This
difference could be due to the size of the organizations, but management consultancies in general do not have
a large sales force, as partners tend to do more of the selling.

### 8. TALENT PILLAR

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

### TALENT PILLAR

The Talent Pillar is the central pillar in Service Performance Insight’s Professional
Services Maturity™ Model. It encompasses every element of the PSO’s workforce
strategy. Talent focuses on both the people, processes and systems required to recruit,
attract, train, motivate, and retain a high-quality consulting workforce. It requires more
attention than ever before due to changing workforce dynamics.

In 2023 talent remains at center stage as both a top challenge and a top improvement
priority in professional services. Inflation, interest rates, global conflict and the new
skills required due to emergence of AI in both professional and private lives have
transformed the world of work. A trend that was exacerbated by COVID, today’s
consulting workforce has become increasingly virtual, with 58 % of the consulting hours delivered off-site.
The new world of consulting work depends on a multi-lingual, multi-generational, multi-cultural, technically
skilled, project-based workforce. Based on technological advances, emphasis is shifting toward business
process and vertical expertise however demand for horizontal application and technical skills remains high.

```
The bottom line in the Talent Pillar is that known best practices of providing clear roles and job
descriptions, timely performance reviews, fair compensation, career planning and skill building
pay huge dividends in employee satisfaction, billable utilization, and on-time project completion.
Executing an effective talent strategy produces a long-lasting payback and should make a short
list for any maturity improvement plans.
```

**Figure 38 : Talent Trends of Note**

***Source: SPI Research, February 2024\***
SPI Research highlighted the talent trends in Figure 38 because they show the movements in the whether
employees recommend their firm to others, employee attrition, and billable utilization. Both recommending
their firm to others and billable utilization went down, just as they both did in 2022. Fortunately, employee
attrition also went down, which bodes well for the organization. There is a long way to go in 2024!

One of the most important challenges for today’s Professional Service leaders is competing for top talent.
Some of the professional services challenges include:

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

∆ Attract, compensate, train, motivate, and retain top talent.
∆ Manage through a technical labor shortage.
∆ Manage a global, multi-lingual, multi-cultural workforce; and,
∆ Manage a variable and/or contingent workforce.
Professional services organizations are judged by the quality of the people within the firm, as well as its
subcontractors and partners. All PSOs must place a premium on the attraction, motivation and retention of
the consultant workforce. Regardless of an organization’s size and performance maturity level, the firm’s
people are the essence of the organization. They determine financial viability, brand quality and client
satisfaction. They define the effectiveness of service marketing, sales and delivery. From inception, all
PSOs must intently focus on their people.

During COVID, the PS market had moved toward virtual consulting delivery. Now, the trend has slightly
reversed itself and consultants have begun to work more at the clients’ sites, but a long way from just a few
years ago. High-performance firms accentuate the benefits of remote work with collaboration tools and
team and skill building combined with flexible hours and childcare.

### Talent Maturity

SPI Research’s “Talent” pillar encompasses all elements of the Professional Services workforce strategy. It
focuses on the people, processes and systems required to recruit, hire, ramp, retain and motivate a high-
quality consulting workforce. Table 101 : shows how PSOs mature across the Talent pillar.

SPI’s PS Maturity™ research over the past seventeen years supports the notion that only a handful (less than
20 %) of Professional services organizations achieve greatness. These leaders can quickly seize market
opportunities and drive best-in-class performance through the effective use of technology in conjunction
with enlightened management and workforce practices (Figure 39 ). Improving talent maturity is the best and
fastest way to improve overall results and must always be a priority. The pillar also highlights how attrition
goes up as the firm matures, making it imperative PSOs do everything in their power to limit start employees
from leaving.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

**Figure 39 : Talent Maturity Matters**

Figure 40 highlights just how billable hours grow as PSOs improve organizational maturity. Productive hours
go up while non-productive administrative hours go down significantly, leaving plenty of time for personal
time off and education.

### 5 - Year Talent Trends

Talent continues to take center stage as the number one priority for all service providers. Over the past five
years, there has not been real growth in annual billable hours (Table 102 ), gravitating between 1, 386 and
1,4 64. The big change has been the movement to deliver services remotely, rather than on the clients’ sites.
On-site delivery has gone down for years but looks like it has stabilized at approximately 40% of the billable
hours. Almost all PS productivity improvement has come from the effective use of technology to lower
overhead and administrative costs in combination with the move to virtual (remote) consulting delivery.

PS employees begin work with the same number of annual hours (2,080 hours) but they work smarter using
agile development methodologies; virtual consulting delivery (limiting travel time); maximizing multi-tasking
across multiple projects while limiting administrative time for time and expense capture and meetings. They
take advantage of knowledge sharing and service productizing to quickly support and propel employees to
greater levels of expertise and productivity. Virtual consulting delivery acceptance has been a boon for the
entire PS industry.

### Survey Results

Today’s Professional Services leaders continue to confront the realities of attracting and retaining a
younger workforce against the backdrop of a technical labor shortage. Globalization has significantly
impacted workforce strategies with many service providers providing hybrid on and off-site resources via

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

regional and global competency centers. Based on technological advances, consulting emphasis is shifting
toward business process and vertical industry expertise however demand for horizontal application and
technical know-how remains high. SPI Research found talent metrics contain some of the highest number of
performance indicators with extremely strong correlation to success — meaning, employees, and how they
perform once onboard determine success or failure.

SPI Research analyzed 19 talent key performance measurements that are critical to attaining superior
employee performance. Table 103 portrays trends in the Talent pillar. The chief issues facing PS employers
are recruiting and retention. Skilled employees have more career choices than ever before resulting in high
levels of voluntary attrition. This year, the number of employees who would recommend their company as a
great place to work decreased. Some overwhelmed consultants have chosen to leave professional services
altogether, preferring the stability and lower stress of corporate positions.

Tables 104 and 105 break down the Talent KPIs by organization market and size. By market, IT consultancies
had the highest billable utilization while Healthcare PS had the lowest. Attrition was very uniform across the
different vertical markets and as one might expect management consultancies, along with software PS, had
the highest fully annual loaded cost per employee.

Larger organizations had higher billable utilization, reflecting better scheduling and adherence to standard
methodologies. But larger companies had higher loaded costs for their employees. Voluntary and
involuntary attrition rose as the organizations grew. This issue must be tackled by leaders to continue their
organizations’ path to prosperity.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

**Consultant Tenure**

In this year's survey, SPI Research asked the average consultant tenure. With higher employee attrition
rates, it has become more difficult to achieve high levels of performance. Many consultants stay a few years
and then move on. In this year's survey, SPI Research found that over 58% of the consultants averaged less
than five years at the firm. Longer duration is highly correlated with better client references and higher on-
time delivery (Table 106).

**The Primary Reason Employees Leave**

```
Employees leave for a variety of reasons but typically there is a primary catalyst for moving on.
```

Turnover will always be an important issue facing PS executives. Employees leave for a variety of reasons. In
many cases there is a primary catalyst which is the reason for moving on. Table 107 shows the top reasons
why employees leave. The number one rationale (37.8%) is “better opportunity” which translates to a better
work environment, better compensation, a better boss or more opportunity for advancement.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

Travel is in second place at 21.8%. Travel, whether too much or not enough, is always an issue in PSOs.
Younger workers generally enjoy travel before they settle down with a family. However, considering now
most consultants work remotely, this result could mean the desire to travel more, which is why this
percentage moved into second place from a traditionally lower ranking.

Money is in third place with 17 .8%. A younger, less traditional workforce requires challenging projects;
exposure to hot new technologies and leading-edge clients plus training, communication and teamwork to
remain engaged, but money is often a determining factor.

**Employee Attrition**

```
Employee attrition is defined as the number of employees who left the company, either voluntarily or
involuntarily, over the past year divided by the weighted average number of employees. (Attrition Rate =
Number of Attritions/Weighted Average Number of Employees * 100).
```

***Employee Annual Attrition - Voluntary\***

Voluntary attrition, employees who leave but are not asked to leave, is one of the most important key
performance indicators in the PS market as employees are the most valuable resource. Annual attrition in
the professional services market rose until 2020, when COVID hit. But in 2021 and 2022 it began to rise again
and rose to 9.3% in 2022. Fortunately, in 2023 it went down to a more manageable 7.3%, the second lowest
percentage in the past five years. As the economy heats up in 2024, which SPI expects, this number could
rise again.

Table 108 shows the correlation between organization size, headcount growth, project overruns and
profitability, demonstrating the negative consequences of high voluntary attrition rates. As attrition rises,
most other aspects of performance suffer. Less success in sales and on-time project delivery decreases
while project overruns increase. Achieving financial goals, especially profitability, also suffers as voluntary
attrition rises. Remaining employees must pick up the pieces from exiting workers and must quickly come
up to speed to reestablish client relationships. Clients are forced to back-track to reestablish previous
decisions and vendor commitments.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

The costs of high voluntary attrition permeate all aspects of the firm. Lower employee engagement
influences the firm’s ability to recruit new top talent. The very real cost of replacing employees that leave
shows up in 12 8 workdays on average to find, recruit, hire and ramp new consultants. But this lost time is
just the tip of the iceberg, as it does not measure lost productivity time for recruiters and managers nor the
impact on the remaining workforce from taking over work after a valuable employee has left or the time
spent ramping and mentoring a replacement hire.

SPI Research believes the real cost to replace a valuable consultant is more than $150,000, creating a big
bottom-line profit divot and making it hard to increase revenue and margins when firms must backfill
employees who leave. Table 109 shows voluntary attrition went down from 2022 to 2023 in both embedded
and independent firms. Unfortunately, APac was one area where attrition rose, perhaps due to a sluggish
economy and uncertainty, like during the COVID period.

***Employee Annual Attrition - Involuntary\***

Involuntary attrition or layoffs have a temporary positive impact on revenue per consultant and employee, as
well as utilization because the available work is performed by fewer employees. However, the long-term
effects of involuntary attrition show up in lower top-line growth and poor employee engagement.
Interestingly, voluntary attrition rises directly in response to involuntary attrition as non-impacted
employees fear they will be next or become disenfranchised with their prospects for long-term career
growth. Table 110 shows the correlation between involuntary attrition and performance in several pillars.

Involuntary attrition rose from 4. 4 % to 5.1% in 202 3. Embedded organizations showed a reduction while
independent professional services organizations had a significant increase. The APac region had the

**Days To Recruit and Hire for Standard Positions**

SPI Research considers the length of time to recruit and ramp new employees to be very important
determinants in overall performance and sustainable growth. Ramp time is critical because it not only
focuses to make employees productive faster, but also reduces the non-billable time and cost of other
resources who support the hiring and on-boarding process.

Most firms do not track the full cost of recruiting and hiring, but it is substantial (in many cases over 50% of
the first-year new hire base salary). This year the average cost of recruiting is 1.0% of total revenue. The
most mature firms create a dedicated recruiting function, armed with in-depth skill and personality profiles
for targeted positions. Since all indicators point to a continuing talent shortage in PS – firms would be well-
served to examine and improve their recruiting, on-boarding and training functions. Recruiting must be
closely aligned with the sales pipeline and resource management plan.

Table 112 compares the time required to recruit for standard positions (such as consultants) to other key
performance indicators. As it takes longer to recruit and hire, billable utilization suffers, because current
employees must spend more time helping with the process, which limits their billable time. On-time delivery
is reduced because more seasoned employees are tasked with time to hire and ramp new employees plus
new hires are not available to fill required roles and may make mistakes due to inexperience. Clearly
organizations with long recruiting times need to do a better job of defining roles and starting the recruiting
process in time to fill critical resource requirements. Maintaining a “warm pool” of candidates is a good
practice.

The time it takes to recruit and hire for standard positions went up by nearly a day-and-half a day in 202 3.
Embedded service organizations showed a four day decrease while the independents reduced it by 2.5 days.

**Days For a New Hire to Become Productive**

Well-structured on-boarding and mentoring programs are mandatory for PSOs that plan for significant
growth. In 202 3 the average time for a new hire to become productive decreased from 62.7 days in 2022 to
62.5 in 2023. PSOs have focused on this metric for some time, but over the past few years lately it has risen
due to the war for talent. It was good to see its reduction in 2023.

Embedded service organizations typically take much longer for a new hire to become productive. The
reason is that their software, hardware or other technologies tend to be more difficult to learn than the

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

average independent consultant who typically has the skills already. The Asia Pacific region did the best job
of minimizing days for a new hire to become productive. As expected, IT consultants had low numbers too,
as most new employees already have enough technical skills to become productive fast. The largest firms
took longer to make employee productive due to greater complexity and more bureaucracy.

**Guaranteed Annual Training Days Per Employee**

```
The guaranteed number of training days per employee per year is the average number of training days
budgeted each year per employee.
```

Like the annual training budget, this indicator, while promised to employees, is not necessarily utilized. It
does reflect the organization's commitment to employee development and shows the organization is
investing in the future of its employees. Across the benchmark the average cost of training is approximately
1.0% of total revenue. Leading organizations mandate more than two weeks of training per year.
Approximately 20% of firms provide three weeks or more of training per year. Several leaders put new hires
through intensive three-month scenario-based training programs where they work as a team to develop
requirements, architect and implement real-world solutions. PSO leaders find investments in both technical
and interpersonal skill building pay dividends. In this year’s benchmark, higher numbers of guaranteed
training days positively correlate with project durations and margin (Table 116 ).

Access to high quality training is a major attraction driver. Many firms report they bring together the entire
consulting team twice a year for skill-building, reinforcing the company’s direction and strengthening
collaboration and team building. Team meetings give road warriors a break and allow them to establish new
friendships and partnerships while rejuvenating. Several of the high-performance PSOs include significant
others and spouses in their annual events to thank them for holding down the fort while their road-warrior
partners delight clients.

In this year's survey the guaranteed annual training days per employee went down from 10.3 in 2022 to 10.0 in
2023 (Table 117). Both embedded and independent professional services organizations increased training.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

The largest increase was in APac, which added nearly three days. Both the Americas and EMEA reduced
training days over the past year.

**Employee Billable Utilization**

```
SPI Research defines employee utilization on a 2,000 hour per year basis. Employee billable utilization is
calculated by dividing the total annual billable hours by 2,000.
```

Employee billable utilization is central to organizational profitability. Utilization is consistently the most
measured key performance indicator but must be examined in conjunction with overall revenue and profit
per person along with leading indicators like backlog and size of the sales pipeline to become truly
meaningful. Utilization is a major indicator of opportunity and workload balance. It provides a signal to
expand or contract the workforce.

To improve margins, PS executives must continually focus on increasing employee billable utilization, as
well as increasing the percentage of billable employees. The primary gain from increased utilization is a
significant increase in net profit. Table 118 shows the benefits this year’s firms experienced from increasing
employee utilization. The results favor organizations who reported billable utilization over 80%.
Understandably, firms that report the highest levels of utilization also deliver the largest projects, making it
easier to keep utilization high without the churn associated with short projects. Running a growing PS
organization at greater than 80% utilization can produce strong profits but may not be sustainable over the
long run as employees’ burnout and leave. At the other end of the spectrum, organizations that reported less
than 50% utilization reported the worst metrics in all categories except attrition. The key to success is to
have the right balance of meaningful work with enough time set aside for skill and client relationship
building.

Although many PS firms would prefer to abandon the billable utilization metric (and all the accompanying
time tracking it entails), there is no other metric that provides as good a picture of workforce productivity.
Perhaps as more and more firms shift to fixed price work the focus on billable utilization will decline but if

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

this is the case firms must ratchet up their focus on project accounting and budget to actual performance.
But here again, how can budget to actual performance be measured without tracking work hours?

Billable utilization went down in 202 3 – to its lowest level over the past five years – at 69.3% (Table 119)!
Except for Software and SaaS PS and Agencies, every market showed lower billable utilization. SPI Research
believes PSOs should try to attain at least 75%, meaning 1,500 billable hours annually.

**Annual Fully Loaded Cost Per Consultant**

```
Fully loaded cost includes base and variable compensation as well as the cost of fringe benefits and
healthcare.
```

Annual fully loaded cost per consultant was originally thought of as a negative KPI, as the more a PSO paid
consultants, the lower the profit. That assumption turned out to be incorrect as SPI study after study has
shown ***as the fully loaded cost increases, so does performance maturity\***. Over 55% of firms reported a fully
loaded cost between $100k - $150k (Table 120 ). Only 3.9% pay more than $200,000. The firms that pay the
most are larger and have some of the best financial results.

**Recommend Company to Friends and Family**

```
Recommending one’s company to family and friends as a “great place to work” is an important measure
of employee engagement.
```

Recommending a company to others is an excellent barometer of employee satisfaction. Table 122 shows
the powerful impact of workplace satisfaction. The good news is 38 % of the organizations surveyed would
strongly recommend their firm. Great places to work are characterized by high employee engagement, a
strong culture of achievement and confidence in the future.

Table 123 shows employee engagement trends by geography, vertical and size of organization. 2023 results
showed this KPI down across all regions, organization sizes and markets, which should be a sign to all PSOs

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

that there could be issues with employee satisfaction, which is a major driver of client satisfaction and
overall productivity.

**Well-Understood Career Path for All Employees**

```
A well-understood career path is a very important KPI to measure PSO commitment and employee
motivation and retention.
```

The survey asked if the organization provides a well understood employee career path, meaning as
employees are hired and move within different roles, and was there a planned next step for their career
progression (Table 124 )? This KPI is important because it shows the firm’s commitment to employee skill
growth and career development. Even though the question is subjective, and answered by PS executives,
who might show bias, the results demonstrate how important career development is.

The table shows employees with a well-defined career path are more likely to recommend their firm as a
great place to work and are less likely to leave. Interestingly, employees work harder to deliver larger
projects on time and with higher margins. The results show significantly higher profits as employees see a
career path for themselves.

**Employees Have the Tools They Need to Deliver Quality Services More Efficiently and
Effectively**

SPI Research asked for the first time whether employees have the tools they need to deliver quality services
efficiently and effectively. This question is highly correlated with some of the more important key
performance indicators. As is shown in Table 126 , firms where employees with the right tools grow faster,
recommend their firm to others, and have higher levels of billable utilization and on time delivery, which
translates into higher margins. This is a very important KPI, as it leads to greater productivity and
profitability in the professional services market.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

**Annual Hours**

PS executives always ask SPI Research how professional services consultants spend their time. Most
executives want to keep their people billable for at least 75% of the available hours annually (1,500 hours).
For senior consultants, where they might have many other duties other than just billing, utilization could be
less than 25%. For new (or junior level) consultants, utilization could exceed 100% (over 2,000 hours
annually). Annual hours are always one of the most anticipated metrics from the annual PS Maturity™
benchmark survey. Most organizations put a lot of focus on consultant time spent on both billable and non-
billable tasks. ***Across the benchmark, billable hours increased slightly in 202 3 to 1,4 13 from 1,4 04 in 202 2
(Table 127 ).\*** Larger PSOs provide more training and fewer hours on non-billable administrative time, but still
provide plenty of training hours.

***Billable Hours\***

The following sections highlight how much the market has changed over the past year in terms of delivering
services remotely. PS executives realize this trend will continue for some time. In fact, most consultants
favor remote working or hybrid working and will probably leave firms that mandate returning to on-site work.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Talent Pillar**

To have the right tools and infrastructure that support remote employees will be more critical than ever.
Firms would be well-advised to not force a “return to work” policy without continuing to offer more flexibility.

**Billable Hours On-site**

The number of hours worked on-site increased from 497 to 586 , reflecting a large change in the remote
service delivery strategy. But by no means does SPI Research expect on-site billable work to go back to over
60%.

**Billable Hours Off-site**

Most PSOs have thoroughly reexamined their operations on the topic of onsite versus offsite delivery. They
have invested in mobility (through laptops, VPNs, videoconferencing, and “virtualization” tools) but are also
wary of “Zoom” fatigue and scheduling too many meetings. SPIs own experience is that PSOs have used the
past four years wisely to invest in streamlining business processes and try to eliminate the annoying tasks
which alienate workers. Timely, relevant communication with remote workers and customers is critical. One
source of the truth regarding upcoming projects, available resources and project status has become a
necessity which is why there has been a surge in demand for project-based ERP and standalone PSA
applications. Remote hours went down by 9 % in this year’s benchmark (Table 1 3 1). Organizational size did
not really matter but by vertical market it did. AE firms, agencies and Healthcare PS moved work back to the
client site in 2023.

## 9. Service Execution Pillar

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

### SERVICE EXECUTION PILLAR

The Service Execution Pillar measures the quality, efficiency and repeatability of service
delivery. It focuses on the core activities for planning, scheduling and delivery of service
engagements. Regardless of the maturity of every other area of the PSO, it will not
succeed unless it can successfully and profitably deliver services, with an emphasis on
quality, timeliness and customer value.

The Service Execution pillar is where money is made in professional services. Work must
be scoped, bid, sold, delivered and invoiced to generate revenue and maximize project
margin. The alignment of sales, HR, service and finance is critical for success. All project-
related information (time, expense, project details and knowledge) must be captured to be
invoiced and to improve the next service delivered.

SPI Research highlighted the Service Execution pillar trends in Figure 41 because they are important to project
delivery success. As discussed earlier, billable utilization is one of the most important KPIs in Professional
Services. Unfortunately, it went down as did both on-time project delivery and project margin. These lower
figures could negatively impact PSO’s ability to grow in 202 4.

In an increasingly competitive consulting marketplace, success most often comes down to operational
excellence – with visibility and management controls in place to ensure effective resource and project
management. Done right, gross project margins of more than 60% are possible. Done wrong, project yields
can drop to single digits, or go negative.

### Service Execution Maturity

SPI has analyzed most aspects of service delivery for decades. This area has experienced the most
improvement as firms have realized resource specialization and visibility to all facets of project delivery are
critical. PSOs have incorporated automation, virtualization, analytics and integrated business applications
into their service delivery fabric. The technology underpinning service execution has been a major catalyst for

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

improvement as resource management, project management, collaboration, time and expense capture and
billing have all benefited from the emergence of a host of cloud-based tools. The other big advancement is the
nature of the work itself. Today, few firms worry about fixing the plumbing before they can focus on
simplifying business processes as agile delivery methods have become the norm along with advanced
workflow, reporting, process automation and artificial intelligence. Every facet of service execution has been
improved and benefited from new technologies, making it far more enjoyable to be a consultant in today’s
world. The necessity and now acceptance of remote service delivery has removed some of the stress of travel
and allowed consultants to work from home.

Figure 42 shows just how important performance maturity is in the Service Execution pillar. The figure shows
the importance of selling larger projects and utilizing effective resource management processes. Firms that
use a standardized (repeatable) delivery methodology show improved on-time delivery, project margins, and
higher profit.

Table 132 highlights the maturity levels in the Service Execution pillar, as the PSO moves from basic reactive
“all hands-on deck” project delivery to greater efficiency, repeatability and higher quality service execution.

### Survey Results

In 202 3 SPI Research found a reduction in size of projects in terms of revenue, people and project duration
from 2022 (Table 133 ). For the most part service execution suffered.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

The reduction in performance from 202 2 to 202 3 shows up in both embedded and independent service
organizations, as well as by region. 2020 was an anomaly, and in 2021 PSOs tried to get their footing back on
the ground. In 2022 , SPI Research expected PSOs should have performed admirably, but 2022 was another
one of “those years”, with all the economic uncertainty and supply chain issues. Most performance suffered as
the effects of the past three years continued to linger. 2023 brought more issues, ranging from inflation and
interest rates, which hurt growth and delivery suffered.

Smaller PSOs did a much better job of completing projects on time and on budget, with fewer overruns. PMO
use became more prevalent as the size of the firm grew.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

**Resource Management Processes**

```
Resource management process shows how organizations staff projects, from a centralized management
process, to local, account based, horizontal or center of excellence.
```

SPI’s research shows there is not one resourcing strategy that is clearly superior to all others. The five
strategies that follow enable PSOs to manage talent and fulfill client demands. Although centralized resource
management is the most prevalent strategy, each organization must create a resourcing strategy that works
best for their business, with the goal of increasing utilization *and* client and employee satisfaction.

1. **Centrally managed** – Most resource management pundits favor "centralized" resource management. It
   provides superior management visibility into the entire project backlog and the level of skills required
   both today and in the future. In centralized resource management, a dedicated resource management
   team is responsible for managing the master resource schedule and making staffing decisions based on
   skills, availability, location, cost, preference, etc. Centralized management is the most efficient way to
   manage a large workforce. In this year’s benchmark, centralized management produced some of the
   best results with fewer project overruns and the best revenue per consultant and project margins.
2. **Local resource management** – Local resource management is the preferred form of resourcing for
   young organizations where the workforce is small enough to foster real esprit de corps, and employees
   wear many hats. Smaller organizations can't afford the overhead of a dedicated resource management
   function, as relationships and roles are fluid, requiring more local control and finesse. Staffing locally
   also provides the benefit of closer client relationships and less travel.
3. **Account-based** – Resource management by account may be a good strategy for very large accounts
   where there is a strong backlog of projects, but account-based resourcing can cause big issues if
   account revenue dries up. The other drawback to account-based resourcing is that it narrows
   consultant range of experience as teams are not exposed to diverse business models and client
   challenges. Further teams run the risk of “going native” – feeling more affinity with their clients than
   their employers, which may mean they cannot push back on unreasonable requests.
4. **By horizontal skill set** – Managing resources by horizontal skill set is useful for developing best
   practices, repeatable processes and shared knowledge. For example, many firms have project and
   program managers report directly or indirectly to the Project Management Office (PMO). By building
   affinity around "birds of a feather," project managers or specialized consultants can more easily share
   best practices and standardize methodologies, templates, etc. As organizations grow, a horizontal or
   competency-based overlay reporting structure can help firms develop repeatable best practices and
   deep, shared domain expertise while still enjoying the efficiency of centralized management.
5. **Centers of excellence** – The current trend towards vertical and offshore Centers of Excellence (COE)
   was pioneered by Accenture over the last decades. The advantage of industry-specific "Centers of
   Excellence" is the development of deep industry domain knowledge. In theory, each Center of Excellence
   acts as a clearinghouse for specialized knowledge, expertise and solutions. Clients and prospects
   delight in seeing a "Vision of the Future" for their unique industry challenges. The downside of COE can
   be excessive overhead, the creation of an ivory tower mentality along with the inability to learn from
   emerging new horizontal and vertical trends. Further, use of horizontal skills sets and technologies
   outside the COE can become cumbersome and inefficient. Centers of Excellence are favored for
   outsourced consulting – particularly development and managed service centers where consultants are
   collocated to maximize collaboration, repeatability and quality control while minimizing cost.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

To improve utilization, PSOs must improve resource management effectiveness. As Table 137 shows, there
are pluses and minuses to different resource management strategies. Green shading indicates “Best” while
red shading indicates “Worst” based on responses from 575 firms (Other PS not included). This year “By
Centrally Managed” comes out on top with the highest number of “best” scores.

The table shows just how different the performance levels are with each resource management process. It
makes sense that on-time project delivery would be high when the resource management process is done by
account. Account managers can have greater control over project deliverables. But managing resources by
skill set leads to greater efficiency and thus higher margins. PS leaders must balance their primary goals of
revenue growth, organizational profit, and both client and employee satisfaction to ensure the firms
progresses in a positive way.

**Revenue Per Project**

```
The average revenue per project is calculated by dividing the total revenue of the service organization by
the total number of projects delivered. This KPI provides insight into the size, scope, and duration of
projects.
```

The average revenue per project is important from a planning and execution perspective. PS executives would
naturally prefer large projects with many billable consultants and for extended durations. This format is
preferable to forecasting personnel and revenue. However, the market is changing, and PS executives now do
a much better job of planning to meet revenue and profitability targets.

Unfortunately, PSOs complete many small projects along with a few larger ones, which may skew revenue per
project. Wide variability in project size stresses resource management predictability and may make project
management unaffordable. Most financial metrics improve with project size as it is easier to staff and
forecast large projects. Larger organizations build “rapid response” teams to handle short, unpredictable
projects. The 5-year average revenue per project is $17 9 k. In 202 3 it was $ 183 k, which is down from $ 203 k in

1. 

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

Table 138 shows both revenue growth and billable utilization increase significantly as the project size
increases. This bodes well for the financial metrics as revenue goals are attained and higher project margins.
Larger projects are preferable, but PSOs must have the structure in place to deliver efficiently and effectively.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

**Project Staff Size**

The project staff size is the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees dedicated to projects. Shorter,
more iterative, “agile” projects cause more scheduling issues but may result in improved project value and ROI.
Table 140 shows projects with a larger staff show the highest percentage of standardized delivery
methodologies used, but lower on-time delivery, meaning PSOs have much to do to improve. Ideally, PSOs
should sell larger projects but staff them with fewer resources, which is no easy task. It is more difficult to sell
large projects and they tend to be the most prevalent for larger PSOs, that can handle global scale and
complexity. In the 202 3 study, the average project size in terms of staff was 4. 42 people, down from 4.51 in
2022 (Table 141).

**Project Duration**

The average project duration, expressed in months, refers to how long it takes to deliver projects. The average
project duration, like average project staff size, is important in that it shows the length and scale of projects.
Longer projects may be easier to forecast and staff but are not necessarily more profitable because they may
entail more risk and complexity.

The average project duration has gone up from 5. 56 months in 201 9 to 5.76 in 202 3 , peaking in 2022 at 6.44,
and with a five-year average of 5.9 4 months. Table 142 shows larger projects increase billable utilization but
may cause higher attrition as employees finitize more with their clients and less with their employers. Larger
projects help with predictability but may also involve greater complexity and risk resulting in more project
overruns. Projects under three months in duration stress resource scheduling, resulting in poor billable
utilization.

**Concurrent Projects Managed**

In 2023, SPI Research asked PS executives the number of projects a project manager manages concurrently.
The more projects managed means greater efficiency, but performance could suffer if the project manager is
overwhelmed with work. Table 144 shows the breakdown in the number of projects managed by a project
manager. What stands out is there tends to be a higher percentage of new clients as the number of projects
managed grows. Fortunately, project managers can manage more projects if a standard delivery methodology
is used. Unfortunately, on time delivery and project overrun suffer as the number of projects increases. SPI
Research believes project managers should probably manage no more than five projects concurrently.

**Concurrent Projects Worked by Consultants**

In 2023, SPI Research also asked PS executives the number of projects consultants work on concurrently. Like
the project managers, the more projects managed means greater efficiency, but performance could suffer if
the consultant is overwhelmed with work. Table 145 shows the breakdown in the number of projects managed
by a project manager. Interestingly to SPI Research, employee attrition goes down as they work on more
projects concurrently, but unfortunately on time delivery and project overrun suffer as the number of projects
increases. SPI Research believes consultants should probably limit their number of projects to less than five.

**Project Management Office (PMO)**

The use of a project management office aids project teams in terms of efficiency and quality. SPI Research
asked how often PSO's utilize the PMO. The results are highlighted in table 146. The results are interesting to
SPI Research in terms of organizations that utilize a PMO sell bigger projects and utilize standardized delivery
methodologies more often. However, project overrun rose as PMO's were used, but the project margin
increased. The project management office is good for larger organizations with more complex projects.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

**Standardized Delivery Methodology Use**

```
The percentage of projects where a standardized (or structured) delivery methodology is used.
```

Standardized delivery methodologies incorporate best-practices, time and quality into projects. These
repeatable frameworks include tools, templates and knowledge. Mature firms invest significant time and
attention into methodology development to standardize delivery processes; define expectations and
institutionalize quality. Using a standardized delivery methodology is a critical component of a services
productization strategy. It helps improve project forecasting and resource management, thereby improving
profitability. PSOs that can accurately plan and execute services in a structured way are not only more
productive but also more likely to deliver on time and with quality. There is significant effort involved in
developing, implementing and adhering to standardized delivery methodologies, but the net impact for PSOs
is beneficial. Table 147 shows the use of standardized delivery methods and tools has a positive impact on
growth, billable utilization and revenue target achievement.

**The frequency on a project the contract needs to be modified due to scope change**

```
The number of times the scope and contract are modified during a project.
```

Project scope change can drive performance negatively if not managed correctly. Project managers must
manage changes in scope with the appropriate hours and cost. In many instances clients realize they need
more help with the project and then ask for modifications that incorporate more activity. This change could
give the PSO more money if managed correctly, but in many instances the hours and dollars don't add up to a
sufficient margin and the PSO suffers. Table 149 shows the impact of more scope change. On time delivery
and margin are reduced when this happens and overrun increases.

**Projects Delivered On-Time**

```
The number of projects completed on time is divided by the total number of projects.
```

The percentage of projects delivered on time is a critical measurement for billable service organizations,
because when it decreases, both profitability and client satisfaction decline. Over 25% of PSOs reported
delivering less than 70% of their projects were delivered on time (Table 150). PSOs that could not deliver on
time had much lower levels of billable utilization and client references. They had ineffective processes for
change control, project quality and knowledge management. They also did not have visibility into resource
availability, which meant they missed their annual margin targets. The bottom line is on-time delivery is one of
the most important KPIs, and its success or failure impacts the overall organization. Clearly project overruns
are one of the root causes of missing on-time delivery milestones but so are poor communication; miss set
expectations; lack of change orders and scope creep.

Fortunately, over 20% of firms reported 90% or better on-time project delivery. On-time, on-budget project
delivery is one of the best quality measurements, as it indicates alignment and visibility across the entire
quote to cash process. Sales sells services that the PSO has the capability to accurately estimate and staff.
Resources are aligned with project requirements, so they can deliver within promised timelines. The rewards
for on-time delivery are ample with the best client references, lowest employee attrition and highest
employee engagement and billable utilization. PSOs that struggle with on-time delivery must closely examine
and improve their sales, estimation, contract and delivery processes as the benefits of on-time delivery are
significant.

**Project Overrun**

```
Project overrun is the percentage of actual-to-budgeted cost, or actual-to-budgeted time.
```

Project overrun may be expressed in actual time/cost versus plan. This KPI is important because any time a
project goes over budget in either time or cost, it cuts directly into PS profitability. Project overrun has a
profoundly negative impact on almost all aspects of service execution as it puts stress on service delivery and
forestalls new project initiation. For the 9.7% of firms that reported greater than 20% project overruns,
performance suffers (Table 152).

Like on-time delivery, project overruns hurt both cashflow and margins. Project overruns are most likely to
occur when delivering new services or attempting to implement unproven technologies. Clearly, the first step
towards minimizing project overruns is to understand where and why the project went awry. Project reflection
reviews and lessons learned will help reduce future overruns.

**Project Margin**

```
Project margin is the percentage of revenue which remains after accounting for the direct costs of project
delivery.
```

Effective resource management and driving high billable utilization is a key ingredient in project margins but
so are repeatability and quality of project delivery along with effective project management. Regardless of the
size of the organization, SPI always recommends maintaining a project dashboard with visibility to project
budget to actual performance. Figure 43 shows average project margins vary greatly but have been close to
the five-year average of 35. 5 %. The overall project margin in 202 3 was 34.4%, down from 35.0% a year earlier.
This metric underscores the importance of a holistic view of PS, as one important metric like project margin
can cause a ripple effect leading to lower overall net profit.

Leading PSOs strive to achieve project margins over 40% but as the figure shows, 3 2 % of the organizations
surveyed consistently achieve project margins greater than 40%. Low project margins are caused by a variety
of issues including poor estimates, scope change, lack of a clear project charter, poor project management,
poor execution and communication combined with not having enough or poorly prepared consultants. PSOs
with lower project margins struggle to meet annual margin targets. Very few organizations make more than
30% margin on subcontractors.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

Projects can be structured in a variety of ways

- fixed price, milestone based, time and
  materials or cost plus. Typically, time and
  materials-based projects produce the best
  margins if bill rates are set appropriately. “Not
  to exceed” projects should be avoided as they
  provide none of the benefits of fixed price
  projects but carry all the risks. Cost-plus
  contracts are also undesirable; they are most
  prevalent in government work, which tends to
  be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Clients and
  service providers alike should focus on paying
  fairly for work that delivers promised results.
  If the project benefit is substantial, then
  assuring successful delivery should be the
  primary focus (Table 154).

Project margin is the essential building block of productivity and profit for all PSOs and is a metric that must
be carefully measured and tracked. High project margins are associated with high billable utilization, on-time,
on-budget delivery and revenue per consultant and employee. Standardized delivery methods and tools
combined with project quality reviews and training investments all correlate with the highest margins. When
projects are delivered on time, time and materials project margins increase, and so does revenue per
consultant and employee. And since project margin is where most of the profit is made in PS, overall EBITDA
increases as T&M project margins rise.

Table 155 highlights the benefit of higher time & materials project margins. They are typically driven by
standardized delivery methodologies, coupled with high billable utilization and on time delivery. The net
results benefit many of the financial aspects of the PSO.

***Fixed Price Project Margin\***

Table 157 shows 31% of organizations achieved fixed price margins of more than 40% but unfortunately nearly
40% reported fixed price margins of less than 30%. Clients appreciate the simplicity of fixed price bids, which
transfer risk to the service provider. Fixed pricing is appropriate for standardized projects with clear
deliverables but should be avoided for projects involving a lot of unknowns like new technology, new

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

geographies, new deliverables, and scarce resources. In general, most service providers do a poor job of
managing change orders.

***Subcontractor, Offshore Margin\***

Subcontractor, or third-party use has remained relatively constant across this benchmark, averaging 11. 0 % of
revenue over the past five years. Although service providers would prefer to use more contingent labor, only a
few are available on an on-going basis. Further, highly skilled independent consultants understand their value,
which is why average subcontractor margins have hovered at 28 % for the past five years.

Table 159 shows significant benefits for the few firms that enjoy greater than 40% subcontractor margin with
commensurate overall project margins and annual revenue per consultant and employee. These organizations
are more likely to judiciously use subcontractors because they use standardized methods and tools. A word of
caution – excessive use of subcontractors undermines quality and knowledge capture leading to
commoditization.

**Service Delivery Effectiveness**

Process effectiveness analyzes how organizations manage various service delivery processes (estimating,
resource management, change control, quality, knowledge management) on a scale from 1 (very ineffective) to
5 (very effective). Because project/service delivery is where money is made in professional services, SPI

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

Research analyzes the various processes associated with it. The following sections highlight the results of the
five aspects of project/service delivery.

***Resource Management Effectiveness\***

SPI Research asked survey respondents to rate the effectiveness of their resource management process.
Resource management is critical to project planning and execution. PSOs who effectively and efficiently
manage resources show much higher client referenceability, utilization rates, larger projects with less overrun
and higher revenue per billable consultant. Clearly, resource management effectiveness directly improves
with the use of PSA solutions.

***Estimating Process and Review Effectiveness\***

SPI Research asked survey respondent to rate the effectiveness of their estimating processes and estimate
reviews. This key performance indicator is important as accurate estimates hold the key to all other service
delivery metrics. Inaccurate estimates and poor pricing controls lead to miss-set client expectations, project
overruns and poor client satisfaction. While this subjective KPI might be hard to fathom, its results show how
some of the most important KPIs improve as the organization becomes more effective in pricing and
estimating. Billable utilization, longer duration projects and revenue per employee rise as firms are more
effective with their estimating and process review processes. Estimating requires significant investment in
methodology development and scoping projects to the task level, but obviously from this table it is well worth
the effort to ensure accuracy and continual improvement.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

***Change Control Effectiveness\***

SPI Research asked survey respondents to rate the effectiveness of their change control processes. All
projects involve risk and scope change. The important question is how these variables are managed. Mature
PSOs invest in the development of change and risk management policies along with project management
oversight and guidance. Clients and service providers alike must consider the impact of changes and how they
will affect timelines and subsequent projects. A critical component of change control is to ensure project
margins do not suffer. Ideally, project changes are clearly outlined; client perception is appropriately managed
and change orders are put in place. Too many change orders not only impact the budget and schedule but are
signs of scope creep as well as inadequate executive sponsorship and poor communication.

Table 165 compares the effectiveness of change control processes to other key performance indicators.
Again, like the organizations with high levels of resource management and estimating effectiveness, those
organizations that manage change the best demonstrate significantly better KPIs in both the service
execution and finance and operations pillars. PSOs that focus on basic execution issues such as resource
management, estimating and change control drive superior results compared to those organizations that
place less emphasis on these critical business processes.

***Project Quality Process Effectiveness\***

SPI Research asked executives to rate the effectiveness of project quality processes. Quality must be a core
organizational attribute that is built into the culture and management practices. Most leading professional
services organizations build in quality checks and balances to assure the work is done correctly. As more PSOs
work to productize their services offerings, they must incorporate quality processes and procedures, as well
as metrics. High quality service delivery underlies client satisfaction and drives referrals and repeat business.
Table 167 shows results improve across the board as quality processes are implemented.

***Knowledge Management Process Effectiveness\***

PSOs have begun to improve the capture, package and repurpose of knowledge. High-performance
organizations understand differentiation comes from their unique knowledge and their ability to create,
harvest and repurpose industry-leading intellectual property. Although a plethora of powerful and inexpensive
knowledge management tools exist, they lose their effectiveness without a centrally managed and
empowered knowledge management function. The key to knowledge management is not only capturing it and
codifying it but also continually pruning it and improving it. In today’s world of social media overload, great
search capability is a must to surface the best knowledge when it is needed.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Service Execution Pillar**

SPI Research asked benchmark respondents their opinion of the effectiveness of their knowledge
management processes, with a rating of 1 = very ineffective to 5 = very effective (Table 169 ). Knowledge
management has become a critical component of service execution. Best practices and other quality-driven
initiatives are built into project delivery. Assurance that the right information is available to those who need it
is paramount to success. Over the past five years knowledge management, especially using social media and
collaboration tools, has moved to the forefront of service execution. Team members now work more
collaboratively to achieve project objectives. The table shows that effectiveness of Knowledge Management
processes has a positive impact on both service delivery and financial results.

## 10. Finance and Operations Pillar

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

### FINANCE AND OPERATIONS PILLAR

The Finance and Operations pillar represents the realm of the CFO for large PS
organizations and is an intrinsic part of the role of the chief service executive for all PS
organizations, regardless of size. In this service performance pillar, SPI Research
examines 38 key performance measurements for revenue and margin achievement and
operating expense. The analysis includes detailed profit and loss statements and expense
ratios by organization size, geography and vertical.

SPI Research highlighted the operational trends in Figure 44, and they show a
deterioration in financial and operational performance. SPI Research found the ability to
meet revenue targets (margins as well) worsened in 202 3 , as there were more problems
associated with sales and service delivery. The ability to meet targets and achieve high
levels of revenue per consultant is important but is really driven by operational success. These graphs
highlight the need for PSOs to take a step back and analyze where sales and delivery underperformed and
make modifications to improve both in 202 4.

The COVID-19 pandemic was just the beginning of a transformation on how PSOs deliver projects. It forced
PSOs to accelerate their own digital transformation efforts while turbocharging client demand for services.
For the past three years more than half of the consulting workforce have worked from home, including finance
and operations staff who have had to quickly adapt to running the business virtually. Mobile and mobile
banking are no longer a nice to have, leading to strong PS demand to replace legacy business applications with
modern, integrated suites.

Figure 45 shows the importance of achieving higher levels of performance. The difference between level 1 and
Level 5 is significant. Profitability alone is significantly higher at Level 5, which should make executives take
note. But profitability is driven by so many factors, they must look at the entire organization to begin
improvement. Level 5 organizations operate at a much higher financial level than their peers, and much of this

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

success has to do with structure in the delivery of services as well as visibility across the organization. Change
happens quickly and PSOs that can best prepare and manage change efficiently will succeed over the long
term.

### 5 - Year Finance and Operations Trends

In 202 3 SPI Research saw several financial KPIs go down, including profit. But none of the KPI's went down by
more than 6% except for the quarterly non-billable expense per employee which rose by 12% on a relative
basis. The good news is that profitability only went down slightly as PS leaders managed very well considering
an increase in inflation and interest rates. The setup bodes well for 2024, as inflation has gone down over the
past year and interest rates have most likely peaked, and according to many economists, should go down in

1. 

Table 171 provides more information on the past five years in the Finance & Operations pilar. Costs seem to be
rising but financial performance has improved during the past five years except for meeting revenue and
margin targets. With all the economic turmoil over the past year SPI Research believes the organizations did
well. The quarterly non-billable expense per employee is rising, but much of that is due to inflation and greater
difficulty in finding qualified employees. With the unemployment rate so low, PS executives will have to pay
more over the next few years.

**PS’s Emphasis Between Client Satisfaction and Profit**

In 2023 SPI Research asked whether PSO's were more focused on profits or client satisfaction. The results
came in as one might expect. At both ends of the spectrum there was minimal support. Most organizations
emphasized a balance between client satisfaction and profitability and second, client satisfaction came first.
The health care professional services market was more focused on this balance than others. IT consultancies
and large PSOs had the highest percentage for profitability driven.

**Steps Taken to Improve Profitability**

Organizational profitability went down slightly in 2023. But each year, PS executives work on ways to improve
it. Table 173 depicts improvement priorities from 20 22 to 202 3. Overall, PS Executives believe improving
resource utilization will be the most important way to improve profits as higher utilization yields higher
margins, which can turn into profit. The same thinking exists in embedded service organizations, but the
independents believe improving marketing and sales effectiveness is the best way to increase profitability.
There are interesting distinctions between the regions as can be shown in the table below.

### Survey Results

**Annual Revenue Per Billable Consultant**

```
The annual revenue per billable consultant depicts the service organization’s total revenue divided by the
full-time equivalent ( FTE) billable consultants. Alternatively, this metric is calculated by multiplying the
consultant’s average bill rate times billable hours.
```

Revenue per consultant provides an indication of consultant productivity; the likelihood the firm will be
profitable is foretold by the labor multiplier. SPI Research considers revenue per billable consultant to be one

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

of the most important KPIs, but it must be viewed in conjunction with labor cost. Headcount and capacity
planning are typically based on expectations of a 2x revenue yield to consultant cost. Revenue multipliers of 3x
and higher are typical for engineering and architecture firms while a labor multiplier greater than 3x is
standard in management consulting and legal professional services.

Billable consultant revenue yield is a strong predictor of PS profit. Average consultant annual revenue
production increased from $204k in 2022 to $207k in 2023. Table 176 depicts the impact of increasing
revenue per consultant. All financial metrics improve with higher revenue per consultant. Clearly more
revenue per consultant improves as on-time project delivery does, which also drives higher margins and
profit.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

**Annual Revenue Per Employee**

```
The annual revenue per employee represents the service organization’s total revenue divided by the total
full-time equivalent (FTE) employees.
```

This calculation looks at the overall revenue yield for all PS employees – both billable and non-billable. Annual
revenue per employee is like annual revenue per billable consultant; it divides total PS revenue by the total
number of employees (FTE) but includes both billable and non-billable headcount. Revenue per employee is a
powerful indicator of the overall success of the firm. If the average cost per employee is known, profit can be
estimated by comparing cost per employee to revenue per employee.

Also, like revenue per consultant, this KPI is highly correlated with profitability, utilization and bill rates. PSOs
with a high percentage of non-billable employees or excessive sales, marketing and G&A spending, have lower
annual revenues per employee. Revenue per employee is very important in determining the appropriate size
and financial health of the organization. Based on the high cost of talented consulting staff, SPI Research
suggests this figure should be at least 1.4 times the fully loaded cost per person to maintain strong financial
viability. If the organization achieves an acceptable revenue yield per billable consultant but is below the
benchmark for revenue per employee, this is an indication of excessive non-billable overhead.

Table 178 shows just how important it is to increase revenue per employee. As revenue per employee rises, so
does on-time delivery and profit, and attrition goes down. The higher the revenue per employee, the more apt
the PSO is likely to achieve annual margin targets.

Annual revenue per employee went up from 2022 to 2023. It went up in both embedded and independent
service organizations. SaaS PS, Agencies and Healthcare PS all increased revenue per employee by over 20%

**Percentage Of Annual Revenue Target Achieved**

```
The annual revenue target achieved is the percentage of the annual revenue goal that is made.
```

Many PSOs create detailed annual business plans. It shows how accurate they are in business planning,
forecasting and execution. If the organization does not meet its annual revenue target it is a sure bet that the
annual margin or profit target will also be missed, as most organizations plan their spending based on their
revenue projections. On the other hand, if the organization exceeds its revenue projections by a wide margin
this may result in quality issues, staff burnout and potentially client dissatisfaction because the organization
is understaffed to meet demand.

As Table 180 shows there is a direct correlation between achieving revenue targets and other key metrics. SPI
Research also found PSOs that achieved revenue targets had lower attrition rates, reflecting financial stability
and the organization’s ability to reward performance and reinvest in the business.

**Percentage Of Annual Margin Target Achieved**

```
The annual margin target achieved, like the annual revenue target achieved, is the percentage of the
annual project margin goal that was made.
```

SPI Research measures revenue and margin target attainment to calibrate the accuracy of annual business
plans. Even if PSOs don’t accurately measure other benchmark metrics, they usually know if they achieved
their targets or not. Target attainment is important from a planning and investment perspective. If the
organization does not meet its margin goals it might have to scale back future spending, potentially limiting
growth.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

The number of firms that achieve their margin target is always less than the percentage of firms that achieve
their revenue targets. Only 13.8% of survey respondents achieved 100% or more of their annual margin target!
Table 182 shows a direct correlation between margin target attainment and the key performance metrics
associated with sales. Also, the percentage of billable employees, annual revenue per consultant, margin and
profit went up as margin targets were met or exceeded.

Overall, the change in the percentage of annual margin targets achieved went down by 1 % relatively as the
embedded services organizations rose slightly and the independents saw theirs go down. The percentage in
all three regions went down. Virtually every market covered in this report saw margin target achievement go
down 1% - 5 %, but the largest firms improved.

**Revenue Leakage**

```
Revenue leakage refers to revenue that has been earned but is lost before it can be realized.

Causes of revenue leakage include billing errors, time the firm is unable to bill for product or project delivery
issues, and incorrect statements of work or misquotes. Revenue leakage is difficult to determine in many
cases, making it a “silent killer” of profitability. In many instances, organizations don’t even realize revenue has
not been billed, making it a very difficult figure to calculate. It is also a barometer for overall operational
efficiency, as PSOs with higher levels of revenue leakage reported higher attrition lower client references,
lower utilization, poorer on-time project delivery, and lower margins than organizations that better manage
contracts, capturing all hours and expenses and billing accurately (Table 184).

**Invoices Redone Due to Error/Client Rejections**

```
The percentage of invoices submitted to clients that are rejected due to errors in the amounts, hours
billed, or work done that are rejected and must be modified and resubmitted to the client.
```

Invoices rejected for any reason dip into profit and cash flow, as the PSO must finance the costs incurred
while still delivering the service. Some PSOs do not consider invoices that have to be redone due to
inaccuracies or client rejections in their DSO calculation – they probably should.

If expectations are properly set and time and expenses are accurately reported, ideally no invoice should be
rejected. Invoicing problems tend to be systemic and emanate from the inaccurate capture of time and
expense information; unclear statements of work; lack of approved change orders; inaccurate billing and
exceeding pre-determined spending limits. It behooves all PSOs to understand the client’s purchasing process
before starting work as the negative impact of not being able to collect payment and revise invoices can be
vexing and impact cash flow.

Table 186 shows that while invoice rejection doesn’t cause higher attrition, it is a sign the PSO is not operating
at its highest level. Longer projects tend to show an increase in invoice rejections as project overrun and
could be a contributing factor.

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**

```
The average amount of time (in days) from when an invoice is generated and sent to the client until the
payment is received.
```

Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is one of the most important KPIs for financial executives. It reflects the
importance of accurately producing invoices and efficiently collecting payment. DSO is also a powerful
measurement of client satisfaction, strong operating controls and client creditworthiness. Financial
executives are consumed with Days Sales Outstanding (Table 188). While it might not impact other
performance pillars, it does reflect the importance of accurately producing invoices and efficiently collecting
payment.

**Quarterly Non-Billable Expense Per Employee**

```
All other non-billable expenses spent per employee (cell phones, non-billable travel, training)
```

The quarterly non-billable expense per employee shows how well PSOs manage employee expenses not
related to billable work. Ideally, this metric is minimized, but there are always expenses due to travel, training,
IT and business development that cannot be billed to clients.

The quarterly non-billable expense per employee increased to the highest level since 2019 to $1,716 in 2023.
nearly $20 0 more than in 202 2. Excessive non-billable employee expense is usually a symptom of poor or
ineffective business expense policies. It may also be a symptom of runaway business development costs with
non-essential personnel wasting valuable time and money chasing non-qualified opportunities. Other
common causes of high non-billable discretionary spending are high business development and training
expenses or employee expense misuse. Table 190 shows how many of the KPIs deteriorated as the quarterly
expenses grew.

**Length of time to incorporate a new acquisition**

```
The length of time it takes a PSO to bring in a new acquisition – from contract signing through the new
organization working as part of the acquirer.
```

Mergers and acquisitions have happened more frequently over the past decade as professional services
organizations work to build out their capabilities with a limited talent pool available. In 2023 SPI Research
asked how long it took to incorporate a new acquisition. Of course, smaller firms are more easily assembled
within larger PSO's, and larger firms simply just take longer.

```

The results are highlighted in Table 192. The table shows longer durations of incorporating a new acquisition
yield higher EBITDA, but that is primarily due to the size of the organization acquired. SPI has just begun to
analyze this KPI.

**Executive Real-Time Wide Visibility**

```
The ease at which executives can look across the entire PSO to assess operational information.
```

Real-time information visibility is an important management tool. SPI Research asked survey respondents
whether their executives had real-time visibility into all business activities (sales, service, marketing, finance,
etc.). The rewards are significant for PSOs that have integrated systems and management dashboards that
allow them to pinpoint issues and spot trends in real-time.

Executives who have real-time visibility run companies that are much more profitable than those that do not,
as they are able to take advantage of changing market conditions. Surprisingly, despite market turbulence,
real-time visibility increased this year. Firms intently focused on their sales pipeline and backlog to ensure
they had enough work to keep staff billable.

As Table 193 shows, organizations that have comprehensive visibility can make the decisions necessary to
grow and achieve success delivering projects and have much higher financial metrics. Visibility impacts
performance across the organization and is a hallmark of firms with a strong culture that prize knowledge and
decision-making at all levels, bringing decisions closer to clients and empowering employees.

Extended real-time visibility is only attained through application integration. “Extended” means information
that flows across departments and functions, so that employees have a more complete picture of operations,
and can make quick, fact-based decisions. Without real-time visibility, decision-making can be subjective and
reactive, which hurts business performance. SPI Research believes these results help organizations justify
expenditures in IT to provide the systems and tools they need to visualize, monitor and manage the business.

**PS can accurately forecast revenue and skills**

The importance of planning has already been discussed in this report. The question is, “can professional
services organizations accurately forecast their revenue and the skills required to deliver the revenue?” This
capability is critical to ensure revenue and margin targets are met. Leading PSO's accurately forecast revenue

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Finance & Operations Pillar**

along with the skills required, so they can better understand their financial position. Table 195 shows the
impact of PSOs that do a better job of forecasting revenue and skills. The table highlights higher headcount
growth, but equally important, higher billable utilization and project margins, resulting in greater revenue per
consultant and employee. Planning and forecasting cannot be understated – both are very important.

**Professional Services Profit**

Net Profit (EBITDA) is always the litmus test for aligning all elements of the business. Every aspect of PS
operations has improved over the past 18 years since SPI Research’s inception. Twenty years ago, single digit
profits were the norm in PS. Now the aspirational target for most independent firms is 20%, and 25% for
embedded organizations. PS has clearly become a profitable and essential component of all technology and
project-driven organizations (Table 1 96 ).

```

In 202 3 , direct revenue decreased as a
percentage of total revenue, while indirect
revenue (subcontractors) increased
slightly. Both pass-through hardware and
software revenue also increased.
Reimbursable travel and expense revenue
increased slightly from 2022 (Table 198 ).

Direct labor and fringe benefits decreased
as a percentage of total revenue.
Subcontractor revenue and margin both
increased.

CFOs should continue to carefully review
which costs are essential to grow revenues
and which ones can be cut without
impacting the business. Hopefully, PSO
executives will evaluate the many positive

Table 199 provides income statement comparison for embedded versus independents as well as by
geography. Sources of revenue for independents and ESOs were similar this year but independents derived
slightly less revenue from subcontractors, reimbursable travel and pass-through hardware and software.

Embedded service organizations reduced costs in several areas, which lead to an 18% relative increase in
profitability year-over-year. Unfortunately, independent firms increased most of their costs, which drove
profitability down by 12% on a relative basis.

Table 200 shows income statement comparison for the seven primary verticals represented in this
benchmark. In this year’s survey, SPI Research received profitability metrics from most of the vertical markets
( *only markets with sufficient income statement data are shown* ). This year SPI Research received significantly
more complete surveys from both Agencies and Healthcare PS organizations. Both IT and Management
Consultancies had lower profits in 2023, but the other major verticals showed improvement year-over-year.

## 11. 2023 Professional Services Maturity™ Model Results

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model Results**

### 2024 PROFESSIONAL SERVICES MATURITY™ MODEL RESULTS

Service Performance Insight built the Professional Services Maturity Model™ 17 years ago to diagnose
professional services performance and help PSOs improve. Over 50 ,000 billable professional services
organizations have used the model to benchmark and improve organizational performance. With nearly 6,500
participating billable services organizations (2,898 during the past five years), SPI Research has further
refined the model to improve its accuracy. In this chapter, SPI Research reveals the analytic basis of the
model and gives insight into our survey techniques. For this year’s model, SPI Research used the current
database of the firms surveyed in late 202 3.

575 organizations participated from
September through November of
2023 representing nearly 400,000
consultants worldwide, continuing to
make this the most comprehensive
study of the global PS industry. While
over 70% of the participating
organizations are headquartered in
North America, most firms surveyed
have employees distributed globally,
and SPI Research believes it to be an
accurate representation of the global
PS industry. SPI Research clients
continue to use the model to develop,
prioritize and implement performance
gains.

### Maturity Levels

The maturity rating for each Service Performance Pillar varies based on the performance of the organization.
In each of the five performance pillars, every firm operates at one of the five maturity levels (Figure 46 ):

```
∆ Level 1 (Initiated – 30% of the respondents) : In the initial stages, the focus of the organization is
primarily on client acquisition and building a reference base. To accomplish this core mission, the
organization must recruit and hire excellent staff. Therefore, at Maturity Level 1 the priority focus
areas are Customer Relationships and Human Capital Management.
∆ Level 2 (Piloted – 25% of the respondents) : The organization is becoming a profit center, so focus is
still on client relationships, but human capital and finance and operations have become more
important as the organization moves from a cost center to a profit center.
∆ Level 3 (Deployed – 25% of the respondents) : The organization has now deployed core operating
processes in all five service performance pillars. At this point, the organization must continue to
accentuate Human Capital Alignment, but the key focus has shifted to Finance and Operations and
Service Execution. The organization must start to consider strategy and vision to ensure the focus is
Figure 46 : Professional Services Maturity Model Levels
Source: SPI Research, February 2024
```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model Results**

on the right clients, markets and competition. At this level, the organization must have deployed
standard business processes across all dimensions.
∆ **Level 4 (Institutionalized – 15% of the respondents)** : At this level, the organization must start
optimizing across all dimensions. However, maintaining and growing service revenue and margin is of
paramount importance. The organization must start developing a differentiated approach to clients
with vertical and horizontal market segments and geographies so a focus on the Client Relationship
pillar is critical.
∆ **Level 5 (Optimized – 5% of the respondents)** : The organization has achieved “black belt” status in all
functional areas. Processes are fully developed, deployed and institutionalized. The organization is
now developing comprehensive measurement, monitoring, and optimization processes across all
pillars.
While every organization should strive to attain Maturity Level 5 in each of the five service performance pillars,
some areas are more important than others depending on the lifecycle stage of the company or its market.
For instance, early in the life of a professional services organization client relationships are far more
important than profitability because without clients there can be no future. Over time, client relationships
always remain important, but the organization must equally focus efforts on other pillars. To be a truly
optimized organization, the firm should aspire to reach Level 5 in all dimensions.

**Model Improvements**

Each year SPI Research makes modifications to improve the model based on additional surveys, its own
analysis, and feedback from PSOs that use the model. This year, there were a few changes to the questions
asked, however, they did not impact the model. As is the case each year, not every question is included in the
PS Maturity™ Model. Demographic information is not part of the PS Maturity™ model but helps PS executives
better compare their organizations to the benchmark. This year several questions were removed that SPI
Research felt did not help PSOs improve performance.

**Model Inputs**

SPI Research conducted a correlation analysis between the questions to determine what, if any, impact each
of the key performance indicators (KPIs) have on each other. The questions were then rated by relative
importance from 0.0 (unimportant) to 1.0 (very important) for each of the KPIs. Each question was assigned a
maximum value based on the answer given and the weight of the question. At the bottom of each of the
following tables is the total maximum value possible in each maturity rating. Here is a synopsis of the SPI
Research methodology:

```
∆ Factor : Respondent’s unique answers to the given question. Some questions are answered within a
range to reduce the time to complete the survey.
∆ Weight : The relative value of the question as compared to others. Questions were weighted from 0.0
to 1.0 depending on the overall importance of the question. Questions with a weight of 1.0 are the most
important in determining organizational maturity.
∆ Pillar Correlation : SPI Research incorporates a correlation coefficient for each question to all pillars,
reflecting the inter-relationship that exists between different functions and key performance metrics
```

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model Results**

within PSOs. Correlations range from -1.0 to 1.0 depending on the KPI’s negative or positive impact on
performance.
∆ ***Maximum Score\*** : The maximum score for each question is determined by multiplying the normalized
value of the question by its weight. Scores are normalized on a scale from 1 to 100 and then assigned a
Maturity Level based on a score from 1 to 5.
The minimum scores for each Pillar are summarized in Table 202. The maximum value is 100, which means the
organization is at the “Optimized” level. By design, maturity scores are relative to the size of the survey with
approximately 5% of organizations designated at Level 5 (Optimized) in any given pillar. Moreover, SPI
Research assumes 15% perform at Level 4; 25% perform at Level 3; 25% perform at Level 2 and the other 30%
perform at Level 1. These scores are slightly different from the 20 23 report in most pillars as SPI Research
annually adjusts scores based on economic conditions and the feedback received over the past year.

**Table 202 : Minimum Normalized Performance Pillar Scores**

```
Pillar Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 4 Level 5 Maximum
Leadership (LE) 0.0 56.1 66.3 75.6 89.0 100.0
Client Relationships (CR) 0.0 44.1 54.1 63.0 76.8 100.0
Talent (TA) 0.0 53.9 65.2 76.7 84.9 100.0
Service Execution (SE) 0.0 47.8 60.8 72.6 84.1 100.0
Finance and Operations (FO) 0.0 26.4 39.9 53.1 74.0 100.0
Source: SPI Research, February 2024
```

What might be interesting to readers of this report is that when analyzing the normalized scores (1 to 100) in
each Pillar it shows that no firm scores a “0”, meaning the lowest level of performance, nor does any firm score
a “100”, meaning the highest level.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark PS Maturity Model Results**

SPI Research works with PSOs to improve performance in each Pillar. The analysis highlights how the firm
scored relative to its peers (for example, management consultancies with between 100 and 300 employees)
and the overall survey. This graphical display highlights areas where the organization performs poorly and
where additional attention should be paid to produce improvements. SPI Research recommends firms look
first at the areas performing poorly ( **red** ), as opposed to further improving areas where it already does well
( **green** ). Figure 47 highlights one such example.

**Model Results**

SPI Research analyzed each of the 575 participating firms to minimize any bias when comparing PSOs of
varied sizes. Table 203 shows most organizations in each size category have similar averages for each pillar.
This year’s results show independents scored better in every performance pillar. In the past embedded
organizations exhibited greater maturity in all five dimensions. Embedded PSOs are typically early adopters of
business applications as they receive the benefit of sophisticated IT investments while independents tend to
forego solution acquisition in favor of business development and marketing expenditures. However, in this
year’s survey the Independents operated at a higher overall level. The Asia Pacific region scored highest in all
the pillars, followed by the Americas and EMEA.

In this year’s survey smaller firms scored the lowest levels of maturity. A year ago, they had the highest scores.
Smaller firms tend to be nimbler than their larger competitors and can react to changes in market conditions,
but do not typically have the processes and procedures in place to manage uncertainty and growth.

### The Financial Benefits of Moving Up Levels.......................................................................

The PS Maturity Model™ was developed to demonstrate the importance of organizational improvement using
benchmarks. SPI Research believes that the importance of the Professional Services Maturity Model™
Benchmark is to help organizations improve ***balanced performance across the entire organization\*** , not just in
terms of financial performance. However, if the organization is profit-motivated (which most are), increasing
maturity levels do show up in significant bottom-line profit. Table 206 highlights some of the key performance
indicators by maturity level and should alone be an important reason why PS executives should look deeper
into using it to accelerate both productivity and profit.

This table shows some of the benefits of moving up levels. Virtually every one of the 1 55 + KPIs improve as
firms move up from one level to the next. Most organizations SPI Research has worked with find that
improving by one maturity level annually is about all they can do. While moving up even one level can be
difficult, the model shows the investment is well worth it.

**The Inter-relationship of Pillars**

Process improvements can both positively and negatively impact other key performance indicators (KPIs) in
the same Service Performance Pillar as well as the other four. Some examples include:

```
∆ Leadership issues ( communication, well understood vision, mission and strategy ) can impact the
ability to grow ( Finance and Operations ), staffing levels ( Talent ) and the ability to effectively deliver
projects ( Service Execution ).
∆ Percentage of bids won ( Client Relationships ) impacts margins and revenue growth ( Finance and
Operations ). Winning bids might improve a PSO’s sales effectiveness but might worsen its Finance and
Operations pillar due to lower profit margins if heavy discounting is required to win the bids.
∆ If a project is delivered late ( Service Execution ) it can negatively impact relations with the client and
future sales effectiveness ( Client Relationships ), employee morale (Talent), revenue growth and project
profitability ( Finance and Operations ).
```

SPI Research took these interrelationships into account when building the Professional Services Maturity
Model™ (Figure 48 ). It adds complexity to the model, but SPI Research believes it provides a real-world
balanced view that improves PSOs ability to positively enact change.

### Model Conclusions

In 17 years of building the Professional Services Maturity Model™ SPI Research has seen the correlation of KPIs
vary from year-to-year, as the economy and competitive environment dictate how PS organizations operate.
The model is an aggregate built for PSOs (both embedded and independent), different size organizations, as
well as for the different vertical markets surveyed. Therefore, the results will have some type of “generic bias.”
PS executives who wish to have their organization compared directly to their peer group (i.e., IT Consultants
with 100 to 300 employees) should contact SPI Research.

As organizations grow, they will gain greater operational efficiency and other advantages, while losing
intimacy and ease of communication. Every vertical market has its own constraints, particularly in pricing
strategies, in many cases limiting the ability for high levels of profitability. The key to this maturity model is for
executives to drill down on their own vertical market, as well as organization size, to better determine relative
performance. SPI Research can further segment this information to help PS executives specifically analyze
performance relative to their exact peer group.

Remember, KPIs are correlated, just like departments in PSOs are. Everyone must work together to achieve
performance and overall organizational goals. **Contact SPI Research for more information on the
Professional Services Maturity Model™.**

## 12. Conclusions and Recommendations

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Conclusions & Recommendations**

### CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

2023 was a transitional year to say the least. Both inflation and interest rates never seemed to go down,
coupled with more global conflict and an uncertain economic environment, created problems for the
Professional Services market. However, the market has solid leadership and extremely talented employees.
While things did not go as originally planned, PSOs still grew and profited. Artificial Intelligence is a
transformational technology that’s benefits have just begun to be understood in the market. Uncertainty in a
new technology is good for the Professional Services market, as its clients will need plenty of help.

Of course, 2024 will have its own unique challenges as every year does. The largest might be the elections in
the US, which could cause executives in every industry to pause, as well as the political bickering and
posturing on AI. However, the world keeps turning and those industries that do not continually evolve may
never catch up. That is where professional services come in. Add in this movement from lower interest rates
to AI and one can see why 2024 should be an exciting year in the Professional Services market.

From a performance perspective, SPI Research saw the market take a step back in 2023, much of it related to
all the economic changes and challenges that occurred during the year. SPI Research expects PS executives
to concentrate on revenue growth in 2024 and it could be a year approaching 15%. PSO's did go out and record
a higher percentage of new clients than in the past, and this should bode well for the future.

Billable utilization declined to under 70% for the first time in a while, which might mean a faster movement to
AI and the productivity benefits it can provide. Part of this productivity decline could be related to more
consultants working on site than over the past two years. While on-site work will probably never go back up to
levels that it was before COVID, it should still increase over the next year or two. Profitability went down
slightly in 2023, but most of it was related to independent professional services providers as embedded
service organizations had a relative 18% increase in profit year-over-year.

The technology landscape for professional services is maturing. Planning solutions have become instrumental
to PSO's, especially in times of uncertainty. PS executives realize and their initial annual plan will not be their
final annual plan. Planning must be both art and science for these executives to meet operational and
strategic goals. Likewise, SPI Research has seen Project-based ERP gain momentum in the marketplace.
Best-of-breed solutions will always be part of the technology landscape, but Project-based ERP has shown
significant growth and use as the cloud, AI and cybersecurity become increasingly foundational to the
Professional Services market.

**SPI Research Recommends**

After 1 7 - years of surveys, and hundreds of PS Maturity™ assessment projects, SPI believes the following
steps should be taken to improve overall performance:

1. ***Benchmark and Scorecard:\*** Any realistic performance improvement plan must start with a fact-based
   assessment of strengths and weaknesses. SPI developed this benchmark precisely for that purpose. It
   will help teams analyze performance while visualizing improvement potential.

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Conclusions & Recommendations**

1. ***Prioritize:\*** Armed with a fact-based assessment, any business planning effort must evaluate and
   prioritize improvement potential and priorities. SPI uses several business planning and prioritization
   methods to help teams surface common issues and evaluate alternatives.
2. ***Quick wins:\*** Using the assessment as a guide, teams should determine quick wins – improvements that
   can be accomplished within a year that will significantly move the needle.
3. ***Build your business plan:\*** there are many frameworks that help leadership teams formulate,
   communicate and monitor target results on a regular basis. The most meaningful plans link the
   company, teams, and personal objectives to align the entire organization around measurable
   improvement priorities. Typical goal setting frameworks consist of time and measurement-bound
   objectives, key results and initiatives. Artificial Intelligence (AI) should be part of your planning
   process, it is just too important not to consider!
4. ***Measure:\*** SPI firmly believes you only achieve what you measure. Goals must be specific, measurable,
   achievable, realistic and time bound (SMART). In today’s business climate, measurement and
   improvement must be constant, not just a quarterly or annual process. Running a service organization
   is a game of singles and doubles. Small percentage improvements in just a few key performance areas
   can produce dramatic bottom-line results.
5. ***Continually improve:\*** if there is one thing we have learned, PS is a marathon not a sprint. There is no
   shade. Every element of the business impacts every other element as firms are continually
   discovering, designing and delivering services around the clock. No client or business problem is
   identical to the last so the organization must be constantly learning and adapting. This is not a
   business for those who are not comfortable with being held accountable. There should be very few
   chiefs and mostly Indians in any organization with employees who are willing and able to add value and
   make things happen.
6. ***Improve the IT Infrastructure\*** : One area that tends to bog PS executives down is the lack of actionable
   information. SPI Research believes that executives should consider the IT infrastructure in any type of
   business transformation. Many of the firms that SPI Research has met with just do not have the
   information they need to make real-time decisions. The PS Maturity Model does not work without
   accurate and timely information.

SPI Research continues to advocate PSOs must concentrate on their weakest links, while also continuing to
improve in each of SPI Research’s five core pillars:

1. ***Leadership\*** : build leaders for the future. A new young millennial workforce requires strong front-line
   management and guidance. With changing workforce dynamics, effective, ethical and collaborative
   leadership is required more than ever before.
2. ***Client Relationships\*** : selling professional services has become increasingly difficult, as client
   organizations look for demonstrable value and demand “pay as you go” subscription or consumption-
   based pricing. Marketing and sales campaigns must address clients’ key challenges and provide the
   means for clients to buy the way they want to. New usage-based business models make it easier for

**2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark Conclusions & Recommendations**

```
buyers to buy but more complex for service providers to provide. Measurable business value and
adoption are driving references and growth.
```

1. ***Talent\*** : your talent pool is your most critical asset, and continued understanding of how the workforce
   changes, and how they wish to be treated, from training to compensation to social programs, is critical
   to understand and cultivate a high-quality workforce.
2. ***Service Execution\*** : delivering services on time and on budget with sufficient margin fosters growth
   and profitability. Always keep an eye on project budgets to actuals, eliminating overruns before they
   spiral out of control. You can't have your best people on every project, there must be a mix between
   higher-level skills and lower level and lower cost talent. Implementing standardized business
   processes and systems helps you better understand and track the effort for the services delivered.
3. ***Finance and Operations\*** : keep an eye on the bottom line! Cash flow is critical, and it is imperative for
   your organization to track costs and expenses to determine where improvement is needed.
   Predictable financial performance provides breathing room to make investments into new growth
   areas. Consider a permanent shift away from expensive facilities and lavish meetings. The last two
   years have proven these discretionary expenditures make very little difference in either employee

well-being or business success.^

SPI Research believes benchmarking is an activity that should be conducted continuously, as the insights it
delivers enable PSOs to make changes in real time that are necessary for growth and prosperity. Continue to
compare your organization to the High-Performance PSOs. This information will shed light on best practices
and help galvanize your organization around improvement priorities.

**Stay healthy and best of luck for a prosperous and profitable 2024!**

### Appendix D: Financial Terminology

The following table contains a list of standard key performance measurement terms and definitions used in
the benchmark report. The terms and definitions have been compiled from our knowledge and experience and
a variety of sources including [http://www.wikipedia.org](http://www.wikipedia.org/) and [http://www.investopedia.com.](http://www.investopedia.com./) SPI Research is
interested in expanding and evolving common key performance measurements, standards and definitions for
Professional services organizations. If you would like to add terms or suggest changes, your comments and
suggestions will be appreciated.

ASC606
Developed jointly by the Financial Accounting Standard’s Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), ASC 606 provides a
framework for businesses to recognize revenue more consistently. The standard’s purpose is to eliminate variations in the way businesses
across industries handle accounting for similar transactions. This lack of standardization in financial reporting has made it difficult for
investors and other consumers of financial statements to compare results across industries, and even companies within the same industry.
The rule, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” standardizes and simplifies how companies record revenue in customer contracts. Effective
for fiscal years beginning after Dec. 15, 2017, it covers how businesses report the nature, amount, and timing regarding contracts with
customers.
The impact might not be as significant for companies, such as retailers, that sell products and receive revenue at one time. But for companies
that sell recurring services like subscriptions or licenses, the rule may improve the results.
Under the previous law, if a company for example, sold a 12-month software product license, it could apply only six months of revenue to its
books. It would not be able to count the next six months of revenue until the following year. But under ASC 606 it can count all the revenue at
once.
Attrition % Attrition % = (Voluntary + involuntary) / Total Beginning Employees
Backlog
Backlog = Bookings - Billings
The total value of contract commitments yet to be executed:
Total Backlog = Previous fiscal year’s contracts not yet billed
+ Latest fiscal year’s sales
```

- Latest fiscal year’s revenue

```
Bid Win Ratio
The ratio of successful bids (resulting in signed contracts) divided by the total number of bids or proposals issued. Bid Win ratio is a good
measure of sales and marketing effectiveness because it demonstrates the organization is pursuing appropriate types of business and is able
to beat its competitors.
Billings Completed, accepted work that can been billed (T&M, Work in process, Milestone, Deliverables)
Bookings Signed Contracts (signed PS Agreement + signed SOW + PO)
Burdened Cost
Typically employee burdened costs are the costs per employee for benefits (Healthcare, Pensions, 401K) and an apportioned cost for the
employee’s facility and IT usage + all discretionary expense. The difference between burdened cost and fully burdened cost is that fully
burdened cost includes an allocation for corporate SG&A costs.

Term Definition
Capitalization
Expensed computing equipment: expenses (typically less than $100k) vs. capitalized (paid for over a time period). Servers for example, are
typically capitalized and depreciated over a 3 year period. Capital expenditures usually refer to expenses a company makes for property,
buildings or equipment. Capitalized items typically have a useful life of several years.
Cash The value of the most liquid assets within the balance sheet. Cash equivalents are assets such as money market accounts that quickly and are not subject to significant change. Does not include the value of accounts receivable. can be accessed
Cash flow
Is the balance of the amounts of cash being received and paid by a business during a defined period of time, sometimes tied to a specific
project. The timing of cash flows into and out of projects is used as input to financial models such as internal rate of return, and net present
value.
Cost per person Cost Per person = Base + Fringe (~25%) + Bonus
Days Sales
Outstanding
(DSO)
A measure of the average number of days that it takes a company to collect revenue
after a sale has been made and a bill has been issued. A low DSO means that it takes a
company fewer days to collect its accounts receivable. A high DSO means that a
company is selling its product to slow-paying customers and it is taking longer to
collect money.
Days sales outstanding is calculated as: DSO is a key performance measurement of the
credit-worthiness of a company’s clients; a general indicator for client satisfaction and
the effectiveness of the billing and collection process. DSO is reported either quarterly or annually.
Depreciation An expense recorded to allocate a tangible asset's cost over its useful life.flow while decreasing reported earnings. Because^ depreciation is a non-cash expense, it increases free cash
Direct Costs Cost incurred as a direct consequence of producing a good or service, as opposed to overhead or indirect costs.
EBITDA
Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization. EBITDA equals Revenue minus expenses (excluding interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization). It is essentially net income with interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization added back to it. EBITDA can be used to
analyze and compare profitability between companies and industries because it eliminates the effects of financing and accounting decisions.
However, this is a non-GAAP measure that allows a greater amount of discretion as to what is (and is not) included in the calculation. This also
means that companies often change the items included in their EBITDA calculation from one reporting period to the next.
FASB
A seven-member independent board consisting of accounting professionals who establish and communicate standards of financial accounting
and reporting in the United States. FASB standards, known as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), govern the preparation of
corporate financial reports and are recognized as authoritative by the Securities and Exchange Commission. FASB sets up and oversees
accounting standards for public firms and nonprofits throughout the U.S. that follow GAAP.
Fixed Costs
Fixed costs are costs that remain the same regardless of changes in the business. For example, facility lease costs remain the same for the life
of the lease, regardless of the level of occupancy. If the business is expanding, the percentage of fixed costs may decrease whereas if the
business is contracting, the percentage of fixed costs may increase.
Fringe Benefits
A collection of various benefits provided by an employer, which are exempt from taxation as long as certain conditions are met. Fringe benefits
commonly include health insurance, group term life coverage, education reimbursement, childcare and assistance reimbursement, cafeteria
plans, employee discounts, personal use of a company owned vehicle and other similar benefits.
Gross Margin
Gross Margin = (Total Services Revenue – Expense or Cost to Deliver the Services)
The gross profit generated per dollar of services delivered. A company's total sales revenue minus its cost of goods or services sold. This dollar
amount represents the gross amount of money the company generated over the cost of producing its goods or services.
Gross Margin
Percentage
Gross Margin % = (Total Services Revenue – Expense or Cost of Services Delivered) / Total Services Revenue
Gross Margin %= Gross Margin / Revenue
Gross Profit
Percentage
A company's total sales or service revenue minus cost of goods or services sold, divided by the total sales revenue, expressed as a percentage.
Gross profit and gross margin are used interchangeably.
Income
Statement or
A financial statement that summarizes the revenues, costs and expenses incurred during a specific period of time - usually a fiscal quarter
or year. The statement of profit and loss follows a general format that begins with an entry for revenue and subtracts from revenue the costs of
running the business, including cost of goods sold, operating expenses, tax expense and interest expense. The bottom line is net income (profit).

Profit and Loss
Statement
Labor Burdened
Cost
Labor Burdened Cost per Productive Hour (or Fully-burdened Cost)
(Labor Burdened Cost + gross payroll labor cost) ÷ the number of actual work (productive) hours
Number of actual productive hours ÷ the total additional cost of the employee
= Employee labor burden cost per productive hour
Labor Multiplier
Labor multiplier = total $ amount of labor hours billed / fully loaded (burdened) labor cost
Note: a labor multiplier of 1.0 indicates a breakeven point.
Any usability cost-benefit analysis should value people's time based on their fully loaded cost and not simply on their take-home salary. The cost
to a company of having a staff member work for an hour is not that person's hourly rate but also includes the cost of benefits, bonuses, vacation
time, facility costs (office space, heating and cleaning, computers etc.), and the many other costs associated with having that person employed.
The simplest way to derive the average loaded cost of an employee is to add up all corporate or division expenses and divide by the total
number of productive hours worked.
Commonly, the fully loaded cost of an employee is at least twice his or her salary. This is why consultants charge so much more than regular
employees: their billable hours have to cover the many overhead costs that are implicit for full-time employees. In fact, looking at common
consulting rates for the kind of staff you are dealing with is a shortcut for estimating the fully loaded value of your employees' time.
EXAMPLE:
base rate/hour (BR)= dollar per hour pay for the staff category
OH multiplier (OHM) = firm's overhead (OH) percentage + 100%
Profit multiplier (PM)= profit percentage + 100%
"loaded" rate/hour = BR X OHM X PM
Base rate/hour= $45.00 per hour
overhead multiplier = 135% overhead + 100% = 235% = 2.35
Profit multiplier = 10% profit + 100% = 110% = 1.1
"loaded" rate/hour =^ $45.00 X 2.35 X 1.1^
Lagging
Indicators
Investopedia explains LAGGING INDICATORS
Lagging indicators confirm long-term trends, but they do not predict them. Some examples are unemployment, corporate profits and labor cost
per unit of output. Interest rates are another good lagging indicator as interest rates change after severe market changes.
In services, billable utilization, revenue per person and net profits are lagging indicators because they reflect changes in market conditions after
the change has already occurred.
Leading
Indicators
A measurable economic factor that changes before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern or trend. Leading indicators are used to
predict changes in the economy, but are not always accurate. In services, leading indicators are backlog and sales pipeline because they are
predictors of future revenue.
What Does the COMPOSITE INDEX OF LEADING INDICATORS Mean?
An index published monthly by the Conference Board used to predict the direction of the economy's movements in the months to come. The
index is made up of 10 economic components, whose changes tend to precede changes in the overall economy. These 10 components include:
```

1. The average weekly hours worked by manufacturing workers
2. The average number of initial applications for unemployment insurance
3. The amount of manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials
4. The speed of delivery of new merchandise to vendors from suppliers
5. The amount of new orders for capital goods unrelated to defense
6. The amount of new building permits for residential buildings

Markup % = (Revenue-Cost)/Cost
For example, 60% markup = 40% margin

Measurement
Utilization
Measurement Utilization = (Billable Hours + Approved non-billable hours)/ (2080 hours – Vacations – Holidays) Approved non-billable hours are
usually associated with presales, overtime not billed to clients, customer satisfaction resolution time, internal projects or skills training.
Net Income
A company's total earnings (or profit). Net income is calculated by taking revenues and adjusting for the cost of doing business, depreciation,
interest, taxes and other expenses. This number is found on a company's income statement and is an important measure of how profitable the
company is over a period of time. The measure is also used to calculate earnings per share.
Often referred to as "the bottom line" since net income is listed at the bottom of the income statement.
Net income is calculated by starting with a company's total revenue. From this, the cost of sales, along with any other expenses that the
company incurred during the period, is removed to reach earnings before tax. Tax is deducted from this amount to reach the net income
number.
Non-billable
Travel
Non-billable travel expense represents travel expense which cannot be re-billed to a client. Typically consulting non-billable travel is associated
with business development or training activities.
On-Target
Earnings (OTE)
The typical pay structure for a salesperson is composed of a fairly low basic salary with an additional amount of commission. The package will
usually be called OTE or on-target earnings, meaning that if a salesperson hits the specified target, they will be guaranteed that amount of
money. A higher commission can be paid if the person performs beyond this target.
Operating
Income
Operating income would not include items such as investments in other firms, taxes or interest. In addition, nonrecurring items such as cash
paid for a lawsuit settlement are often not included.
Operating income is required to calculate operating margin, which describes a company's operating efficiency.
Operating Income = Gross Income – Operating Expenses – Depreciation
Operating Margin
Operating margin is a measurement of what proportion of a company's revenue is left over after paying for variable costs of service delivery
such as wages and benefits.
Operating Margin = Operating Income / Net Sales
Operating Profit = (Total Service Revenue – Total cost of service delivery – Total Operating Expense)/ Total Service Revenue
Operating Profit
/ Margin The amount of profit realized from a business's own operations. A ratio used to measure a company's pricing strategy and operating efficiency.^
Overhead Costs
Usually, fixed costs - a business cost that is not directly accountable to a particular function or product; a fixed cost such as facilities.
Costs incurred that cannot be attributed to the production of any particular unit of output.
The general, fixed cost of running a business such as rent, lighting, and heating expenses, which cannot be charged or attributed to a specific
product or part of the work operation.
Profit Margin =
Return on Sales
(ROS)
The percentage of every dollar of sales that makes it to the bottom line. Profit Margin is Net Income after Tax divided by Net Sales.
A ratio of profitability calculated as net income divided by revenues, or net profits divided by sales. It measures how much out of every dollar of
sales a company actually keeps in earnings.

Revenue per
person Actual Bill Rate * Billable Hours + re-billable travel and expense^
Recurring
Revenue
The best revenues are those that continue year in and year out, they are often referred to as “recurring” revenue. Examples of recurring
revenues are multi-year maintenance contracts and multi-year Software as Service (SaaS) subscription revenues. Temporary revenue increases,
such as those that might result from a short-term promotion, are less valuable and garner a lower price-to-earnings multiple for a company.
Run Rate
How the financial performance of a company would look if you were to extrapolate current results out over a specified period of time.^
Subcontractor
Margin Subcontractor Margin = (Total subcontractor generated revenue –^ total subcontractor cost)/ Total subcontractor generated revenue^
Variable Costs
Variable costs are costs that vary based upon usage. Training, travel and business expenses are variable, whereas costs for facilities are treated
as a “fixed” cost because they do not vary based on use. Commonly variable costs may also be termed “discretionary” because management can
make decisions to make or not make the expenditure.

SPI Research has produced several publications for services-driven organizations that include:

```
 2023 Professional Services Talent Benchmark (September 2023): During the second quarter of 2023
SPI Research released a report based on 137 billable professional services organizations, representing
over 50,000 consultants. This important 122-page study profiles talent priorities, the move to virtual
service delivery, level of employee investment and the impact of business applications. The study
provides analysis of target and realized bill rates, compensation and utilization across a broad range of
professional service verticals, geographies and 12 job levels around the globe. It provides an
unprecedented view of Professional Services workforce distribution and composition by industry
segment through an analysis of organization structures for various service segments including IT
Consulting; Management Consulting; Architects and Engineers and embedded service organizations
within Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies.
 2022 Professional Services Automation End-user Survey (September 2022 ): During the second
quarter of 20 22 , SPI Research conducted a Professional Services Automation (PSA) end-user survey. This
examination of 8 8 billable organizations using PSA is truly an independent research study – the PSA
solution providers had no input or control over the survey or respondents. The survey asked both
quantitative and qualitative questions regarding why firms selected PSA, which attributes were most
important, and how buyers perceived their benefits. Most importantly, this study looked at both pre- and
post-PSA deployment. The report contains: PSA definition and core modules, why PSA was purchased,
how PSA is used, user satisfaction with various components and aspects of PSA, pre- and post-PSA
deployment benchmarks, and participant interviews, and long with 44 insightful figures and tables.
 2021 Project-Based ERP Buyer’s Guide (October 2021): The growth engine of the world’s economy has
shifted from manufacturing to project-based, people-centric services businesses. These businesses rely
on project-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), to manage the financial aspects of the firm. These
solutions automate core business processes such as quote-to-cash, resource and talent management,
time capture and billing, and provide the real-time visibility necessary to improve organizational
efficiency and effectiveness.
The Project-Based ERP Buyer’s Guide provides an overview of important trends, business processes and
selection criteria to help project-based businesses evaluate and choose ERP applications, which will
provide the level of insight, management and control needed to improve productivity and profitability.
 2019 PS Human Capital Management (HCM) End-user Survey (September 2019): The 2019 Human
Capital Management (HCM) End-user Survey Report is the first professional services end-user survey. It is
based on 52 billable professional services organizations, and details many of the drivers behind the
purchase and use of HCM, analyses user satisfaction by module, and both qualifies and quantifies its
benefits. The 45-page report consists of 46 figures and tables, and highlights some of the trends in HCM
use, most notable its movement to the Cloud. The average firm size was 446 employees, and the
organizations showed an annual profit of 11.6%.
 2017 Professional Services Automation Buyers Guide (July 2017): The growth engine of the world’s
economy has shifted from manufacturing to project-based, people-centric services businesses. These

 2013 Professional Services Sales and Marketing Maturity™ Benchmark (October 2013): Most
professional services organizations are dissatisfied with their sales, marketing (and packaging)
effectiveness. For the past eight years, over 1,500 PS organizations that have completed SPI Research’s
benchmark surveys have consistently given their sales and marketing efforts failing marks. The results
for the very few firms that have successfully implemented PS sales, marketing and packaging disciplines,
and made these activities central to their value proposition are extraordinary with 47 percent of all
services sold as packaged solutions, 28.6 percent net profit and $255,000 annual revenue yield per
consultant.
