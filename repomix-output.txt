# Framework Validation: Professional Services Operating Model

## 0. Why This Matters (Outcomes)

**Draft Point:** The framework aims to win predictable, profitable work (not heroics), instrument the business so every leader has 3–5 non-negotiable KPIs with weekly rhythms, and scale confidently toward a PE-grade profile (repeatable go-to-market, governed delivery, stable financial controls).

**Validation & Citations:** Predictability and disciplined metrics are critical for professional services growth. Investors and experts emphasize focusing on consistent profitability and data-driven management over ad-hoc "heroics"¹ ². High-performing firms ensure each leader tracks a handful of KPIs weekly, creating a cadence of accountability³ ². Regular metrics reviews (e.g. weekly dashboards) build shared understanding and rapid course-correction⁴ ⁵. Moreover, private equity (PE) and strategic buyers value repeatable sales and delivery processes, diversified revenue, and strong controls. For example, focusing on EBITDA, pipeline strength, low churn, and revenue concentration is known to "drive true valuation" for investors¹. Companies that align operations to these valuation-driving metrics – rather than just revenue heroics – build a more resilient, high-value business⁵.

**Commentary:** Validated. The emphasis on predictable profitability and metric-driven rhythms is well-supported. HBR and industry voices agree that consistent processes + KPI discipline = higher performance and investor confidence¹ ². The focus on PE readiness (e.g. revenue diversity, governance, controls) aligns with common due-diligence metrics (EBITDA, concentration, etc.) that investors use to assess scalability¹. This section is validated by evidence and underscores why a structured approach (vs. heroic firefighting) matters for long-term value.

## 1. Firm-Wide Process Model (Definitions, Owners, Outputs)

**Draft Point:** The framework defines 12 core business processes (Strategy-to-Plan, Market-to-Lead, Partner-to-Pipeline, Lead-to-Opportunity, etc.), each with a single Accountable owner, clear inputs→outputs, a system-of-record, and a small set of KPIs tracked weekly/monthly. Example: "Opportunity-to-Proposal" has Sales Director as Accountable, inputs (discovery notes, rate card) to outputs (proposal, SOW, risk checklist) in a CPQ system, with KPIs like cycle time <15 business days, win rate 35–50%, sold gross margin ≥35–45%.

**Validation & Citations:** Best practices in process governance call for clear ownership and definitions. RACI frameworks insist on one accountable owner per process to avoid confusion⁷. Industry guidance on operating models (e.g. ITIL, organizational design) echoes that each major process should have a designated process owner and measurable outputs⁷ ⁸. The idea of standard inputs/outputs and systems of record aligns with ISO and CMMI process maturity models – a defined process with templates and a system (CRM, PSA, etc.) improves consistency and auditability⁹ ¹⁰. The KPI examples given (e.g. forecast accuracy ±5–8%, MQL→SQL ≥20%, win rate ≥35%¹⁰) are in line with known benchmarks: for instance, only ~20% of orgs can forecast sales within 5%¹¹ (making that a worthy target), and win rates of 30–50% are common in competitive consulting markets¹². Each listed KPI range can be benchmarked:

• **Forecast Accuracy (±5–8% 90-day):** Forecasts within ~5% error are considered "excellent"², though less than 1/5 of companies achieve this¹¹. Targeting ±5–8% is ambitious but aligns with top-quartile sales ops.

• **MQL→SQL Conversion (≥20%):** Industry averages are ~13%¹³, while 20–40% is viewed as a good MQL-to-SQL rate in B2B marketing¹⁴. So ≥20% is at the low end of "good," reasonable for a focused Oracle services niche.

• **Win Rate (35–50%):** A 30–50% win rate is indeed common for consulting firms¹²; 50%+ indicates a highly optimized sales process or strong client relationships¹⁵. The draft's segment-based win rate goal (35–50%) falls in line with these norms¹².

• **Sold Gross Margin (35–45%):** Professional services gross margins typically range ~30–60%¹⁶. A project sold with 35–45% GM is consistent with healthy pricing (since many firms aim for ~40% project margin¹⁶).

• **Other metrics:** Lead response <24h is strongly supported by sales research – contacting leads within an hour yields 7x higher qualification odds¹⁷, and average B2B response times ~47 hours are too slow¹⁸. Thus a <24h response SLA is a best practice (faster = better¹⁷). DSO ≤45 days is also a common benchmark – finance experts deem DSO under 45 as healthy across industries¹⁹.

The structured listing of processes (#1–#12) covers the end-to-end lifecycle from strategy and marketing through delivery and post-project growth. Such comprehensive mapping resembles known models (e.g. SPI's Professional Services Maturity Model or APQC process frameworks) which stress having defined cycles for lead-to-cash, resource management, etc.⁴ ⁵. Each process having weekly/monthly KPI "dials" is in line with building a data-informed team cadence⁴. For example, a weekly sales forecast call reviewing pipeline KPIs or a weekly delivery meeting on utilization and project risk is standard practice in well-run firms⁴.

**Commentary:** Mostly Validated. The single owner per process principle is strongly validated by RACI best practices⁷. The chosen KPIs and targets are generally supported by industry benchmarks, lending credibility (utilization, win rates, etc., see Section 4 for detailed benchmarks). This process model aligns with how mature consulting organizations operate – clear accountability, systematization, and metrics. One area needing evidence is whether all listed input-output definitions and targets are standard. For instance, the draft's specific threshold "proposal cycle <15 business days" or "risk register 100% by kickoff" are logical but specific; no direct published benchmark was found for those (marked assumption due to lack of citation). They appear reasonable (fast proposal turnaround is often cited anecdotally, but no exact 15-day benchmark was found – uncited/assumption). Similarly, "risk register created 100%" is a best-practice assertion (every project should have one) – sensible but uncited. These do not contradict best practice, but we flag that they are framework-specific assumptions rather than externally benchmarked. Overall, the process model is aligned with best practices, with a couple of granular targets (cycle time, 100% compliance items) that are unsupported by external data but plausible. Importantly, no element here diverges from known good practice – the framework is comprehensive and in line with a high-maturity operating model.

## 2. Role Scorecards (Responsibilities & KPIs per Role)

**Draft Point:** Each key role (CEO, COO, Practice Lead, Sales Director, Marketing Head, Alliances Lead, Controller/CFO, HR Lead, PM, etc.) has a scorecard of 5–8 explicit responsibilities and 5–8 metrics. For example:

• **CEO** – Own strategy & capital plan, hold P&L through leaders, manage top-20 relationships (clients & partners), chair MBR/QBR, approve pricing guardrails and leadership hires. KPIs: forecast accuracy ±5–8%, top-3 client revenue ≤30%, bookings vs plan ≥95%, EBITDA margin in band, leadership positions filled 100%.

• **COO/Head of Delivery** – Own PMO, staffing, methods, project risk, PSA data integrity, weekly margin reviews. KPIs: delivery gross margin ≥95% of sold (realization), aggregate utilization 75–80%+, bench ≤8–10%, red-project recovery <2 weeks, milestones on-time ≥90%.

(and similarly for Practice Leads, Sales, Marketing, Alliances, Finance, HR, Project Managers, etc., each with role-specific focus and metrics as listed.)

**Validation & Citations:** Defining clear role accountabilities with metrics is a hallmark of strong management. It's widely recommended that each leader have a short, concrete list of responsibilities and quantitative metrics²⁰ ²¹. For instance, an HR leadership scorecard commonly includes time-to-fill, retention, and training metrics, which we see in the draft (HR Lead KPIs: time-to-fill ≤45–60 days, offer acceptance ≥80%, attrition ≤12–15%, certifications per FTE) – these align with typical HR benchmarks (e.g. ~12% voluntary attrition is indeed a healthy target²² ¹⁴). Similarly, the Sales Director's KPIs (pipeline coverage 3–4×, win rate ~40%, sales cycle, sold margin discipline) mirror standard sales management metrics²³ ¹². A pipeline coverage of 3–4× is commonly recommended in B2B sales planning (3× pipeline to quota is a standard rule²⁴), and maintaining 35–45% gross margin on deals is consistent with consulting pricing benchmarks¹⁶.

The CEO metrics proposed are directly tied to company health: forecast accuracy (validated above, top performers target ~±5%²), revenue concentration ≤30% (investors indeed watch that no few clients dominate revenue – <30% for top 3 is viewed as low risk²⁵ ²⁶), and hitting plan targets (bookings ≥95% of plan is basically meeting sales plan). Revenue concentration: A cited M&A source notes top 3 customers in one case were 27% of revenue²⁵, and buyers become concerned if any one client >20–30% or top few >50%²⁶. So the CEO having a KPI to keep top-3 ≤30% is well-founded to ensure client diversification²⁶.

For the COO/Delivery Lead, the utilization and bench targets are confirmed by industry data: consulting firms aim for roughly 70–80% billable utilization on average²⁷ ²⁸. The draft's targets (senior 70–75%, junior 80–85%) are supported by multiple sources: successful firms average ~70–75% overall²⁷, with junior staff often ~75–85% and seniors ~60–70% due to non-billable duties²⁷ ²⁹. (The draft's senior target 70–75% is a bit higher than some sources' 60–65%²⁷, but another source shows senior consultants/managers can be ~80% in billable firms³⁰; definition differences likely, but 70%+ is still credible for a delivery-focused culture.) The bench target ≤10% is reasonable: large IT services firms often have 10–30% bench at times⁹, and an "optimal" bench is generally kept low (~5–10%) to minimize idle cost⁹. So managing bench under 10% aligns with known challenges (Accenture was noted ~14% bench in one analysis, suggesting >15% is high³¹). The on-time milestone 90% goal is consistent with quality standards (while not explicitly cited, on-time delivery is a universal KPI – one internal dataset showed teams improving from ~75% to ~81% on-time milestones³², so 90% is an aspirational high target – assumption that 90% is ideal, as no specific benchmark found).

The "red-project recovery <2 weeks" (meaning fixing troubled projects quickly) is a sensible internal target but has no external benchmark – this appears uncited (assumption), reflecting the author's experience more than published data. It doesn't conflict with best practice (faster recovery is obviously better), but we note it as a unique metric in this framework.

Overall, each role's KPIs reflect common performance levers: Practice Leads tracking bookings, delivery margin, upsell%, CSAT aligns with managing a practice P&L (customer satisfaction (CSAT/NPS) >~8/10 is a typical target in services). The Sales Director metrics (win rate, pipeline coverage, no slipped deals) are standard except "% no-slip deals" which is a custom metric (presumably measuring forecast discipline – not found in literature, but relates to forecast accuracy). The Marketing Head metrics (MQL-to-SQL ≥20%, SQLs/quarter, CAC payback <12–18 mo, pipeline influence 40–60%, S&M % of revenue) are grounded in marketing ROI principles. CAC Payback of <12–18 months is directly taken from SaaS benchmarks: investors often expect <12 months for SMB and <18 for mid-market customer acquisition payback³³. This shows the framework is adopting SaaS-like financial rigor for a services firm – a progressive but not unheard-of approach for high-growth services (treating each new project's gross margin to recoup S&M cost within a year or so). Sales & Marketing (S&M) expense as % of revenue targets (in §3 of draft) were noted: high-growth firms may run ~12–15% of revenue on S&M and later scale back to ~8–10%. Indeed, professional services have lower marketing spend on average (~6% in general consulting³⁴), but 8–12% or more is seen in firms pushing growth³⁵ ³⁶. In one example, a $10M firm spent ~9.6% on marketing³⁵; Gartner reports average ~10–12% marketing across industries³⁷. So an 8–15% marketing range for high-growth is plausible (though on the high side for services, it matches the draft's intent to "break plateaus" with more spending).

**Commentary:** Validated, with Minor Gaps. The role scorecards demonstrate strong alignment with what each function should prioritize. Each metric can be traced to known benchmarks or logical best practices. We find most KPIs supported by industry benchmarks: e.g. utilization, win rate, pipeline, CAC payback, DSO, attrition, etc., all validated above. A few specific metrics are custom/unsupported externally: "red-project recovery <2 wks", "no-slip deals %", "active join-plays" (for Alliances), or "90-day new hire productivity" (mentioned in HR but not defined in draft). These are sensible internal metrics but uncited. They don't contradict best practice but are unique to the framework. One potential risk is if these custom metrics distract from standard ones or are hard to measure objectively. For example, "recovery time for red projects" requires clearly defining a "red project" and tracking when it turns green – doable, but not a common benchmark, so the company would need to internally calibrate what 2 weeks means (could be aggressive). Overall, however, the role KPIs are comprehensive and evidence-based. Each leader's focus (e.g. CFO on DSO, close time; HR on time-to-fill and engagement) matches investor expectations (e.g. PE firms often scrutinize metrics like DSO and staff churn³⁸ ³⁹). The slight divergence is that few sources explicitly bundle all these metrics in one place; the framework is ambitious in expecting every leader to have such a tight scorecard. Still, this ambition is in line with building an "investor-grade" operation. We recommend only minor refinement: ensure each metric is clearly defined (the draft's Section 4 provides definitions, which is good) and possibly prioritize which are "non-negotiable" vs. nice-to-have if the list gets too long. In summary, ~90% of these scorecard items are validated by evidence or standard practice, with ~10% being framework-specific metrics (marked as assumptions). The concept of role scorecards itself is validated by general management literature on accountability.

## 3. Stage-Based Headcount Mix & Budget % (Evolution with Growth)

**Draft Point:** The framework provides how headcount mix by function and budget allocation (% of revenue) should shift as the company grows revenue. For example, at ~$35M revenue ("Now"), delivery roles are ~72–78% of staff (billable consultants + PMs), with small percentages in Sales (3–4%), Marketing (2–3%), Alliances (1–2%), Ops/PMO (5–7%), Finance (2–3%), HR (2–3%), Admin/IT (2%), Leadership ~1–2%. As revenue scales to $40–60M, $60–90M, $90–120M, the model suggests gradually reducing the delivery percentage (from ~70%+ down to ~63–68% at $90–120M) while increasing support functions (Sales, marketing, ops, etc.) toward ~30% of headcount. This aligns with overhead cost bands of ~15–25% of revenue at scale. The draft also lists "hiring triggers" (e.g. add a Resource Manager when projects ≥12 concurrent or bench >10% for a month; add Alliances Lead when partner pipeline <20% for 2 quarters; add a Proposal Manager if win rate <30% or proposal cycle >20 days; add QA/Methods Lead if >8 concurrent projects or >4% rework).

On budget: It gives target ranges for Sales+Marketing spend and G&A as % of revenue by stage. At ~$33–39M, S&M ~10–12% of revenue ("push upper band for growth"), G&A 6–8%, HR ~1.5–2.5%, Delivery support (tools/QA/methods) ~1–2%. At $40–60M, S&M 12–15% (in high-growth mode), G&A 6–8%, HR 2–3%, Delivery support 1.5–2.5%. Then above $60M, S&M efficiency improves (back to 10–12%, then 8–10% by $90M+), G&A 6-7%, etc., reflecting scale economies. The rationale given: early-stage boutiques can be ~80–90% billable staff (very lean overhead), whereas larger firms trend toward ~70% billable / 30% support, and that overhead costs of 15–25% revenue are typical. Marketing might be 8–15% of revenue in high-growth phases.

**Validation & Citations:** This staged evolution is supported by industry benchmarks: Smaller professional services firms often run "hot" with a very high proportion of billable staff (the draft says ~80%+ delivery at $30M – which is plausible for a boutique). As firms grow, the support staff (sales, admin, etc.) becomes a larger share. External data confirms consulting businesses have the lowest overhead ratios, roughly 15–25% of revenue in overhead costs⁴⁰. CompleteController reports consulting firms' overhead at 15–25%⁴⁰ – which implies 75–85% of cost is direct (billable) and by headcount likely a similar fraction are billable roles. The draft's end-state ~70% billable headcount (30% support) fits that range; 30% support headcount likely correlates to ~20% or so of costs (since billable staff salaries are also higher cost). So overhead cost band 15–25% is explicitly corroborated⁴⁰, matching the draft.

Looking at specific function ratios: At ~$100M revenue, having ~65–70% of staff in delivery (billable) is reasonable – many larger IT consultancies maintain ~65% utilization company-wide (the rest being training, sales, etc.)⁴¹. The connectwise MSP source recommends a 70:30 billable:non-billable hours ratio as healthy⁴², which aligns with ~70% of team in delivery roles⁴³. The draft uses headcount % rather than hours, but in steady state these correlate. So targeting ~30% of employees in non-billable/support by $90M+ is consistent with that guidance⁴³. Early on, only ~10–20% non-billable (80–90% billable) is possible when founders wear many hats – this matches the draft's "Now" stage showing ~78% delivery, and presumably leadership overhead minimal. (We might note a slight arithmetic check: the draft's "Now" percentages add roughly to ~100%, which they do (~88–97% plus leadership 1–2% – small rounding gaps but presumably meant as ranges)). This is consistent with anecdotes that small firms can operate with very lean support (the partners themselves handle sales, admin, etc., keeping billable % high).

**Sales & Marketing spend:** The draft claims 8–15% on marketing alone in high-growth PS firms and total S&M at upper end. While typical consulting firms might spend less on marketing (some studies show accounting/consulting firms spending only ~2–5% on marketing in low-growth mode⁴⁴), high-growth strategy changes that. Gartner's CMO survey (2016–17) found an average of 12% of revenue on marketing across industries³⁷. For professional services, a marketing expert (Jeff McKay) noted there is no single "right" number, but gave examples around 9–10% being invested to drive 20% growth³⁵. The draft's recommendation to push S&M to 12–15% during aggressive growth is in line with SaaS-like thinking. Indeed, OneUpWeb data suggests mid-stage growth companies spend 12–20% on marketing in some cases⁴⁵. The Sopro 2025 marketing spend report noted services/consulting sector tends to be lower (~6%)³⁴, but that's an average including many not aiming for high growth. The framework explicitly calls out using the upper band (12–15%) to "break through plateaus," which aligns with the idea of over-investing temporarily for growth, then scaling back. This is a strategic choice seen in PE playbooks – invest heavily in sales/marketing post-acquisition to accelerate growth, then normalize spending. We don't have a direct consulting benchmark of 15%, but given tech firms often spend 15–25% on S&M, a services firm targeting 12% is aggressive but not implausible. The evidence supports the general trend: as revenue grows, S&M % can be reduced due to efficiency (the draft shows 12–15% dropping to 8–10% at scale), which matches economies of scale and the ability to rely more on referrals and partners later (which cost less).

**Hiring Triggers:** These are more heuristic than sourced. For example: Resource Manager when ≥12 concurrent projects or sustained bench >10%. We did not find an external benchmark that "12 projects = need a RM," but logically, once a certain project volume exists, a dedicated Resource Manager is beneficial (a TSIA or SPI report might mention when firms introduce that role, but no citation was found – likely an assumption from experience). It's reasonable: if bench is consistently above 10%, it signals poor resource allocation, so adding a specialist could help – but this is an internal guideline rather than industry rule (uncited). Similarly, Alliances Lead when partner-sourced pipeline <20% for 2 quarters – this sounds like a trigger to improve partner engagement; again, no external source says "20% pipeline from partners is required," but earlier we saw that 25–30%+ partner pipeline is considered strong⁴⁶. If the company is below 20% and wants more, hiring an Alliances lead could be the remedy. This is logical but assumption. The Proposal Manager trigger (win rate <30% or proposal cycle >20 days) is also a heuristic: a low win rate or slow proposals imply a need for dedicated proposal support. No published benchmark confirms 30% as a cut-off, but recall average win rates ~30–40%¹⁵ – if a firm is below 30%, it's losing too many bids, so adding a proposal specialist could help. Again, a sensible internal rule (assumption). Likewise, QA/Methods Lead when >8 concurrent projects or >4% rework – no formal benchmark, but >8 active projects might strain quality oversight, and >4% rework (defect leakage) might be considered high (some quality programs aim for <2% rework hours⁹ – the draft itself cites "<2/1000 hrs" defect leakage goal in IP accelerators). So 4% is probably double an acceptable rate, triggering a need for a QA lead. These triggers are not from external literature – they appear to be custom rules of thumb. They are not harmful, but should be labeled as internal targets.

**Commentary:** Largely Validated. The overall direction of headcount and cost ratios is well-supported by benchmarks: early-stage = predominantly billable staff, later-stage = more robust support functions, with overhead ~20% of revenue⁴⁰. The target of ~70% billable / 30% support at scale is consistent with maintaining a 70% billable-hour ratio and overhead cost ~20%⁴³ ⁴⁰, which is realistic. The notion that boutique firms run 80–90% billable is supported by anecdotal evidence (founders doing admin tasks themselves), and larger firms having ~30% support is normal. No contradictions here. The budget percentages also follow known patterns: investing heavily in S&M during growth then tapering is a common strategy (though one should ensure not to starve S&M too much post-scale, 8–10% is still healthy). The specific numeric ranges (e.g. HR 2–3%, G&A 6–8%) are reasonable but would vary by firm – however, they fall within typical ranges observed in finance benchmarks (for example, G&A often ~7–10% in mid-size tech companies; in lean services maybe a bit lower – 6–8% seems attainable). We note that these percentages are given with precision but should likely be viewed as guidelines. They appear aligned with consulting industry surveys: e.g. SPI Research often notes total SG&A ~18–20% for PS firms at scale, which maps to S&M + G&A combined in the draft. The hiring triggers are the one area largely unsupported by external evidence – they are internal logic. There is a risk if one treats them rigidly without considering context (e.g. maybe you need a Resource Manager sooner if projects are very large/complex even if fewer than 12; or a Proposal Manager might be justified by other factors than win rate). But as flexible guidelines, they likely pose no harm. We classify those triggers as assumptions (needing evidence), though they are rooted in sensible management intuition. Refinement could include referencing any consulting org maturity models (if available) that say "firms >50 people often introduce roles like…" – but absent that, it's fine as internal guidance. In summary, functional mix and budget guidance is validated by known benchmarks (with evidence for overhead ratios and billable ratios⁴⁰ ⁴³). ~80% of points here are evidence-backed; ~20% (the hire triggers) are assumptions. We recommend documenting those triggers as internal benchmarks and perhaps tracking when they're met to justify role investments.

## 4. KPI Dictionary (Definitions & Stage-Aware Targets)

**Draft Point:** A dictionary of key metrics is provided, with precise formulas and target ranges. It includes: Utilization (billable%) = Billable hours / Available hours (target ~70–75% for senior, 80–85% for junior consultants), Bench % = Unassigned delivery FTEs / total delivery FTEs (target ≤8–10%), Sold Gross Margin% = (Price – direct delivery cost) / Price at sale (target ≥35–45%), Realization% = Delivered gross margin / Sold gross margin (target ≥95%, meaning you retain 95%+ of the planned margin), Change-order capture ratio = CO hours booked / scope delta hours identified (target ≥80%), On-time milestone % = # on-time milestones / total due milestones (target ≥90%), Pipeline coverage = pipeline (next 2 quarters weighted) / bookings target (2 quarters) (target 3–4×), Win rate = deals won / (won+lost) (target ≥35–50%, by segment), Lead response time = median hours from lead arrival to first touch (<24h), MQL→SQL conversion = SQLs / MQLs (≥20%), CAC payback = S&M cost for new ACV / gross margin from that ACV (in months) (<12–18 months), DSO = AR / avg daily revenue (≤45 days), Revenue concentration = % of revenue from top-3 clients (≤30%), Forecast accuracy (90d) = |Forecast – Actual| / Actual (±5–8%), Certification density = Oracle/Kyriba certifications / delivery FTEs (target ≥2 per FTE). The draft emphasizes using simple, auditable formulas and that targets vary by stage (early stage firms might not hit these immediately but should trend toward them).

**Validation & Citations:** Many of these KPI definitions and targets have already been validated in context above, but to summarize with additional source support:

• **Utilization:** Definition is standard⁴⁷. Targets of ~70–85% are widely cited as typical in consulting⁴⁸ ²⁸. Source Stafiz: "successful firms ~70–75% avg; juniors 75–85%, seniors ~60–65%"²⁷. Source EVX: most firms aim 70–85% overall⁴⁸; juniors 65–75%, mid-level 75–85%, senior roles vary 60–90% depending on definition²⁸ ⁴⁹. So the dictionary's utilization targets (Sr 70–75%, Jr 80–85%) are in line (perhaps expecting seniors to be more billable than some benchmarks – likely because in this firm senior = project leads still billing significant hours, whereas in some contexts "senior" included more sales duties at 60%. Within a delivery-focused org, 70% for senior is reasonable²⁷). Thus, utilization targets are validated²⁷.

• **Bench %:** Formula is straightforward (percentage of delivery staff idle). Target ≤8–10% is supported by the earlier discussion – keeping bench under ~10% is often the goal to balance readiness and cost⁹. Large firms struggle with 10–30% bench⁹, so 10% is indeed an "optimal" upper bound. No single published benchmark says "<10%", but the implication from Slide 83 is that even giants attempt to manage down to that range. So this is mostly validated by context (with minor assumption).

• **Sold Gross Margin (GM%):** Definition clear (project pricing margin). Target ≥35–45% – we saw that a gross profit margin of 30–60% is typical in professional services¹⁶. So aiming for ~40% at sale fits the healthy middle¹⁶. Many consulting firms aim for at least one-third margin on projects; 40% is a common target to allow for some overruns and still net ~30%. Validated¹⁶.

• **Realization % (Margin realization):** This essentially measures if the project delivered margin equals the sold margin. A target of ≥95% means you only allow a 5% erosion. This is in line with best-in-class project delivery – hitting or exceeding sold margins. SPI Research often talks about project margin variance; a variance within 5 points is usually good (the draft CFO KPIs even mention "project margin variance ≤3 pts" – that matches 95–100% realization). We don't have a direct external stat, but it's logical and often internal targets are indeed ~100% (no erosion). Assumption validated by common sense and CFO focus on minimal slippage. No contradiction, but no direct citation – mark as accepted practice (uncited).

• **Change-Order (CO) capture ratio:** The goal of ≥80% means if scope increases, you monetize 80% of that effort via formal change orders. While there's little published data on this specific ratio in consulting, it addresses scope creep. Anecdotally, many firms fail to capture a lot of out-of-scope work, hurting margins. Setting 80% as a target encourages rigor (some scope might be too minor or slip through). No external benchmark found – assumption. However, this metric is analogous to what construction project firms track (they try to minimize free work). Given no data, call it an aspirational internal benchmark (needs evidence). Risk if not achieved: margin leakage.

• **On-time Milestone %:** Definition self-explanatory. Target 90% on-time is common in project management circles as a high bar (as noted, one source showed 77–81% achieved in some organization³²; 90% would be best-in-class). This metric is essentially a project schedule adherence metric. PMI and other project frameworks encourage tracking it, though exact % benchmarks vary by industry. We'll treat 90% as a best-practice goal (uncited) – ambitious but not unrealistic for a disciplined firm (possibly a stretch goal).

• **Pipeline Coverage:** Defined as pipeline value / target. We have strong support for a 3× or 4× pipeline coverage rule²⁴. Forecasting tools and sales experts often recommend ≥3× pipeline for a quota period²⁴. The draft's 3–4× aligns perfectly²⁴. Validated.

• **Win Rate:** We validated 35–50% earlier¹². Industry average ~30–50% is common¹⁵. So target ≥35% is aligning with at least average, pushing to 50% for top segments is a stretch but achievable with strong positioning (and indeed 50%+ win rates are seen by "high performers"⁵⁰). Validated.

• **Lead Response Time (<24h):** As discussed, responding within hours dramatically increases conversion⁵¹ ¹⁷. 24 hours is basically the maximum acceptable; many aim for <1 hour. HBR found contacting within 1 hour yields 7x higher qualifications¹⁷, and another study found companies responding within an hour are 60x more likely to convert than those waiting 24+ hours⁵². So <24h is actually a modest ask – best practice is same day (the sooner the better). Validated (fast response is crucial)¹⁷.

• **MQL→SQL 20%:** Already validated – average ~13%, good range 20–40%¹⁴. So 20% is a reasonable threshold of effectiveness¹⁴. Validated.

• **CAC Payback <12–18 mo:** Very much a SaaS investor metric. Benchmarks: Bessemer VC says <12 months for SMB, <18 mid-market³³. Many sources say ~12 months is ideal, up to 18 acceptable for enterprise growth³³ ⁵³. Validated in context (with the caveat this is unusual to measure in pure services, but if this firm has subscription or recurring revenue or just uses project gross margin vs S&M cost, the metric can be applied).

• **DSO ≤45 days:** Classic benchmark – as Versapay noted, DSO below 45 days is generally good across industries⁵⁴ ¹⁹. Validated.

• **Revenue Concentration ≤30% (Top-3):** Validated above – keep top clients below ~30% of revenue to avoid major risk²⁵ ²⁶. Many investors indeed look for this; one source said top 5 customers ~30% is median in SaaS⁵⁵, and >50% among top few is risky²⁶. Validated.

• **Forecast Accuracy ±5–8% (90 days):** Forrester/Xactly consider <5% error "excellent"². Only 20% achieve that¹¹. So ±5–8% is an excellent target. It might be tough, but it aligns with aiming for best-in-class forecasting. Validated conceptually (with recognition that it's hard – but that's why it's a goal).

• **Certification Density ≥2/FTE:** This metric is specific to Oracle/Kyriba context – wanting each consultant to hold at least 2 relevant certifications. Oracle's partner program often requires a certain number of certified individuals to attain tiers (e.g. Oracle Cloud partners need multiple product certifications). While we didn't find an exact published benchmark "2+ certs per consultant," this is a common internal goal for specialist firms (ensuring deep skills). Oracle University's free cert programs for partners indicate Oracle encourages broad certification uptake⁵⁶. Also, partners achieving Oracle specializations usually have to train several staff. We treat this as good practice but uncited. It's plausible: many firms might say, e.g., "all consultants must have at least one certification; senior consultants 2+" – the draft's average ≥2 per FTE means juniors maybe 1, seniors 3+, etc. No direct data, so assumption. However, it aligns with the notion of investing in skills (which can be a competitive differentiator and is noted to improve performance⁵⁷). High certification counts could also positively influence partner status (as the draft notes in Alliances KPI: certification count). We'll mark it as reasonable assumption (no contradiction).

**Commentary:** High Validation. The KPI dictionary is the backbone of making the framework measurable, and nearly all metrics listed are industry-standard definitions with targets that match benchmark ranges. We have cited evidence for the majority of these KPI targets (utilization, win rate, pipeline, conversion rates, DSO, etc.). A few are custom and lack external data: specifically, change-order capture 80%, and certifications ≥2/FTE are not found in literature. These should be flagged as internal targets. Neither is harmful: 80% CO capture encourages proactive client negotiations, and certs/FTE encourages training – both positive, just not externally benchmarked. There is a slight risk if 80% CO capture is taken as universal without considering client relationships (in some cases, strict change orders can upset clients; firms sometimes accept minor scope creep for goodwill – but 80% allows 20% flexibility, so that seems balanced). Everything else is strongly supported by best practices. The clarity of formulas ("simple, formula-based, auditable") is also commendable – it aligns with advice that metrics must be clearly defined to be effective⁵⁷. We do not see divergence; rather, we see strong alignment with what an "investor-grade" KPI set would include. If anything, the framework is comprehensive – it covers sales, delivery, finance, HR, and quality metrics that PE firms or due diligence teams would love to see tracked. We recommend ensuring that the organization does not get overwhelmed by too many KPIs; however, since they are grouped by process/role, it's manageable (each leader focuses on their subset). In summary, about 90% of the KPI dictionary points are validated by evidence, and the remaining ~10% are logical assumptions. The risks of unsupported elements are low – they represent aspirational performance (which can be refined over time). To refine further, the company could periodically benchmark these metrics against industry surveys (for example, participate in PS industry benchmark studies to get peer comparisons for utilization, etc., and adjust targets accordingly). Overall, this KPI dictionary is robust and investor-friendly, needing only minor tweaks on the uncited items.

## 5. Governance Cadence (Meetings & Accountability Rhythms)

**Draft Point:** A regular governance calendar is outlined: Weekly – Sales Forecast meeting (60 min Wed, Sales lead accountable, with Practice Leads consultative) to decide commits and pricing exceptions; Delivery/Resourcing meeting (60–90 min Mon, COO accountable) to decide staffing allocations, address project risks, trigger change orders; Exec Huddle (30 min Tues, CEO/COO/CFO/etc) focusing on top 5 variances. Monthly – MBR (Management Business Review, 2 hours) for practice P&Ls and KPI trends, CEO accountable, focusing on corrective actions; Talent Review (60 min) to review hiring pipeline, bench plan, cert targets, led by HR. Quarterly – QBR (Quarterly Biz Review) for strategy refresh, partner QBRs (with Oracle/Kyriba), IP roadmap, and pricing guardrails review. The idea is a "lightweight, enforceable" cadence where each meeting has a clear owner and decisions, avoiding overlap.

**Validation & Citations:** Establishing a rhythm of business with weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings is a well-known management practice. Many scaling companies adopt an operating cadence popularized by systems like EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) or OKR cycles: e.g. weekly leadership meetings, monthly deep-dives, quarterly strategy sessions. The specific meetings listed map to key functions: a weekly sales pipeline review is standard in sales management – it ensures forecast accuracy and accountability for deals (CSO Insights found frequent forecast meetings are part of companies that hit accuracy targets⁵⁸). A weekly resourcing/delivery meeting is common in project organizations to balance staffing and address issues quickly (in agile terms, it's like a scrum-of-scrums for delivery managers).

Though we don't have a direct external source enumerating these exact meetings, we can infer best practice: For example, Harvard Business Review has noted that weekly team metric reviews and frequent check-ins lead to better alignment and faster corrective action⁵⁹ ⁵. The draft's "Exec Huddle" focusing on variances is akin to what scaling companies do to stay agile – a short stand-up for leadership to address any fires or big deviations (this idea resonates with agile and OKR check-ins where leadership monitors key metrics weekly⁶⁰).

Monthly business reviews (MBRs/QBRs) are a known discipline in larger firms and PE portfolios. PE firms often implement a 30-60-90 day and then quarterly business review cycle with management to track improvements. The investor confidence index (Section 7) being used in QBR is exactly what many PE operating partners do – scorecard reviews each quarter¹. The draft's mention of MBR on practice P&Ls and KPI trends aligns with focusing each month on unit economics and performance – which is good discipline. McKinsey and others have written about the importance of regular operating reviews to instill performance culture (though no direct cite, this is widely accepted). A monthly talent review meeting, while not universal, is increasingly common given talent is the lifeblood of consulting. By reviewing pipeline of hires, bench, and development monthly, the firm ensures HR issues are not left unaddressed – this is in line with strategic HR practices (some companies do this quarterly or as part of QBR, but monthly is fine if it's brief).

The quarterly strategy refresh and partner QBRs make sense. Oracle and Kyriba partnerships typically involve QBRs with the vendor's partner managers, where joint pipeline and plans are discussed – having an internal meeting around those ensures the firm is prepared and making the most of alliance programs. Also, reviewing IP roadmap quarterly keeps innovation moving. Pricing guardrails quarterly – essential to ensure the company's pricing stays aligned with cost changes and market (makes sure gross margin targets are met).

Essentially, the governance cadence reflects a cascade of meetings: weekly to run the business, monthly to review and adjust tactics, quarterly to revisit strategy. This cadence mirrors advice from scaling frameworks (e.g., Verne Harnish's Scaling Up suggests a daily huddle, weekly meeting, monthly and quarterly/annual planning). Here, daily huddle is not mentioned (they have weekly "exec huddle" instead), which is fine at this firm size. The weekly meetings are specific and not too many, which is "lightweight" as desired. Each has an accountable owner – again, RACI principle of one "A" per meeting for decisions⁷.

**Commentary:** Validated. While we didn't find a single source listing exactly these meetings, the structure is very much best practice for cross-functional alignment. The governance model ensures all key areas (sales, delivery, exec, talent, strategy) get regular attention at the right frequency. There is no part of this cadence that stands out as odd or unsupported. If anything, we might refine by ensuring meeting efficiency: e.g., the Exec Huddle should indeed stick to 30 min and only 5 variances to avoid turning into another long meeting – this is consistent with agile leadership practices (focus on exceptions). The draft explicitly says "lightweight, enforceable," which is good – many companies have meetings but lack discipline; here each is tightly scoped. This is aligned with advice from productivity coaches that meetings should have clear purpose and owner⁶¹.

One could argue if anything is missing: maybe a quarterly Board meeting (but that's external governance, not internal – presumably the CEO handles that as needed). Internally, the framework covers it. No contradictory elements here; it's all supported by management literature and PE ops experience (PE firms often impose a weekly flash report and monthly financial review – this covers those bases, plus operational metrics). We consider this fully validated by general best practice (with the caveat that we rely on broad management references rather than specific citations, because meeting cadence tends to be described in books and frameworks rather than academic articles – but it aligns with known frameworks like Rockefeller Habits, EOS, etc.). Therefore, this section is validated. All points are essentially common sense or widely adopted – none need flagging as unsupported.

## 6. RACI Snapshot for 12 Core Processes

**Draft Point:** A RACI matrix snippet is given for each of the 12 core processes (from section 1), clarifying who is Responsible (R), Accountable (A), Consulted (C), Informed (I) for each. It notes "Define the 'A' once per process; avoid overlaps." For example: Strategy-to-Plan: CEO = A, CFO/COO = R (perhaps), Practice Leads = C, all = I. Market-to-Lead: Head of Marketing = A, Marketing team = R, Sales/Alliances = C, CEO/COO = I. Lead-to-Opp: Sales Director = A, SDR/AE = R, Marketing = C, Practice Leads = I. Opp-to-Proposal: Sales Director = A, Pre-sales SA & Proposal Mgr = R, CFO/Legal = C, CEO/COO = I. … and so on through Close-to-Setup (COO A), Demand-to-Resource (COO A, Resource Mgr R, etc.), Deliver-to-Value (PM A, team R, QA C, etc.), Change-to-Cash (Controller A, Billing R, PM/COO C, CEO I), Offer-to-Talent (HR Lead A, Recruiters R, Practice Leads/COO C, CFO I), IP-to-Accelerators (Methods/QA Lead A, PMO R, Practices C, COO I), Client-to-Advocate (Practice Lead/KAM A, Account Managers R, CEO/Sales C, Delivery I). The key principle is one "A" per process and clarity in roles.

**Validation & Citations:** The RACI (Responsible-Accountable-Consulted-Informed) model is a well-established tool for clarifying roles in processes and projects. A known best practice in RACI usage is to have exactly one Accountable per task/process – the draft explicitly follows this ("Define the 'A' once; avoid overlaps"), which is correct. Having multiple Accountables causes confusion and inaction⁷. So the approach is sound.

Each process's RACI assignment in the draft aligns with reasonable expectations of role responsibility: e.g., marketing process (Market-to-Lead) accountability sitting with Head of Marketing (makes sense, marketing owns that funnel top), sales processes with Sales Director accountable, delivery with PM or COO accountable as appropriate, etc. This ensures clear ownership – which is exactly what investors want to see (who is accountable for each part of the business machine).

Because this is an internal responsibility mapping, we don't find external "benchmarks" per se (RACI charts are company-specific). However, we can cross-check logic: For instance, Offer-to-Talent (recruiting) – having HR Lead accountable and involving Practice Leads and COO as consulted is logical because HR runs recruiting but needs input from practice heads on needs, and COO for approvals. Change-to-Cash (billing/collections) – Controller accountable, with PM/COO consulted (they need to ensure timesheets etc.), CEO informed – good governance because the CFO organization should own cash collection. These all align with segregation of duties and process ownership principles. Another example: Client-to-Advocate (account management for cross-sell/reference) – the Practice Lead or KAM accountable is right, they own client relationships post-project, with Sales and CEO consulted/informed. This ensures someone is clearly driving upsells and references, which often falls through cracks if not assigned.

No obvious divergence: it appears the RACI was thoughtfully assigned following the single-A rule and making primary execution roles "Responsible." This resonates with organizational design frameworks where front-line roles are R (doers), their leader is A (owner), others support or need updates as C/I. For instance, Corporate Coach Group on RACI says each task one Accountable and typically one Responsible (or a team)⁷ – the draft doesn't list multiple R's in the snippet except where a team is implied (e.g., "Alliances mgrs" could be multiple R's under Alliances Lead). This is acceptable as long as within that team the manager is accountable.

**Commentary:** Validated. The RACI matrix is internally consistent and follows best practices (one Accountable). It brings clarity to the earlier process model by explicitly assigning roles. For a "PE-ready" organization, having such a RACI chart is a plus – it demonstrates organizational maturity (everyone knows who owns what). It's lightweight here (just a snapshot), which is fine. We mark this as fully aligned with best practice (no external data needed beyond the rule of one A, which we cited⁷).

If anything, a refinement could be ensuring that this RACI is communicated and used – sometimes companies make RACI charts and then forget them. Given it's in the framework, I assume they will use it to avoid turf wars. No unsupported elements here – all assignments are logical. One could argue whether a particular role should be consulted vs informed in a specific process, but that's detail. The key point is each process has one owner (Accountable) – and that is absolutely validated by management best practice⁷. Thus, this section is validated in full.

## 7. "Investor Confidence Readiness Index (ICRI)" – A Measurable Proxy

**Draft Point:** This is a proposed 10-point scorecard (index) to replace vague notions of "inspiring confidence" with concrete measures. It includes dimensions and metrics with weights: Forecasting (12%) – 90-day accuracy ±5–8% for 3 rolling quarters; Delivery Control (12%) – firm-wide realization ≥95%, red-to-green project recovery <2 weeks; Client Diversity (10%) – Top-3 clients ≤30% of revenue; Revenue Quality (10%) – Backlog coverage (next 2 qtrs ≥1.2× target), upsell ≥15–25% of bookings; S&M Engine (10%) – Pipeline coverage ≥3–4×, MQL→SQL ≥20%; Talent Engine (10%) – time-to-fill ≤60d, attrition ≤12–15%, certs ≥2/FTE; Financial Ops (10%) – DSO ≤45d, close books by WD+5, AR >60d ≤10% of AR; Methods/IP (8%) – reuse ≥3 assets/project, method compliance ≥95%; Alliances (8%) – ≥25–35% pipeline sourced/influenced, Oracle OPN status green; Org Maturity (10%) – role coverage vs stage (i.e. have you hired those roles per stage 3), and OPEX within bands (from section 3). Each dimension has a weight, summing to 100%, and the guidance "Score: Σ(weighted points). Set ≥80/100 as 'PE-ready'." Essentially, if the company scores 80 or above on this composite, they are likely to inspire investor confidence as a well-run firm.

**Validation & Citations:** This ICRI is a composite of many previously discussed KPIs, tailored to what an investor (especially PE) would look at. While the exact concept "ICRI" is the author's own, the metrics chosen echo known due diligence checkpoints. For example, a due diligence guide from CompanySights lists metrics like Revenue per Employee, function mix, etc., for benchmarking in diligence⁶² ⁶³. Our focus here: what do investors care about?

• **Forecast accuracy** – We have established that less than 20% of companies can forecast within 5%, so if a firm demonstrates ~±5% accuracy over 3 quarters, that will impress investors¹¹. It shows predictability of earnings, which is highly valued (PE firms dislike surprises). So including that is valid.

• **Delivery Control (margin realization)** – This is crucial in services: investors will check if projects consistently hit their margins or if there are overruns. Achieving ≥95% of sold margin indicates tight execution (which reduces risk of profit erosion). Red-to-green recovery is a bit specific but essentially measures how quickly issues are resolved – an indirectly important factor (showing an effective PMO). We don't have an external measure for "red project recovery," but the idea is if problems are fixed fast, client satisfaction and financial impact are managed, which investors would appreciate qualitatively.

• **Client Diversity** – Absolutely a diligence factor. Many due diligence reports explicitly mention customer concentration risk (if one client is, say, 50% of revenue, PE will either walk or insist on an earn-out to mitigate that risk)²⁶. So <30% from top 3 is a good threshold to show no heavy dependency²⁶.

• **Revenue Quality (backlog and upsell)** – Investors love to see a strong backlog (future revenue locked in) as it de-risks forward projections. Backlog coverage ≥1.2× next 6-month target means you already have 6+ months of revenue in bookings – very comforting to PE. Upsell (expansion revenue) 15–25% indicates account mining ability, which in services is akin to recurring revenue or at least repeat business, boosting customer lifetime value. This is a key value driver (and 15–25% is in line with earlier target for expansion bookings). So good.

• **S&M Engine** – Pipeline coverage and lead conversion speak to the viability of sales/marketing. These we have validated. If an investor sees 4× pipeline and improving conversion, they know growth targets are plausible²⁴.

• **Talent Engine** – Time-to-fill, attrition, certs: All reflect how well the firm can maintain and grow its talent base. High attrition (>15%) is a red flag in due diligence (could signal cultural or competitive issues). ≤15% voluntary attrition is decent for consulting (industry average voluntary attrition often ~15% or higher in IT consulting, so keeping it at or below that is good). 60-day time-to-fill shows the recruiting engine can scale headcount as needed (important if growth requires adding talent quickly). Certifications per FTE reflect capability depth (especially valued by vendors and clients). PE firms often examine whether a services firm has the capacity (people and skills) to deliver projected growth, so these are relevant.

• **Financial Ops** – DSO, timely close, AR aging: These are classic financial due diligence points. Efficient close (by workday 5) and low aged AR indicate strong financial controls and cash management. PE investors will certainly check AR aging; >10% over 60 days could signal collection issues – so ≤10% is a good target. These metrics demonstrate good working capital management and reporting discipline (which are definitely confidence-inspiring for an investor). This matches general finance best practices (keep DSO low, close the books fast for visibility).

• **Methods/IP** – This dimension is a bit unique to this framework; it measures how well the firm leverages intellectual property and follows standard methods. PE firms do value firms that have repeatable IP or accelerators (it can be a differentiator and potentially monetizable). Tracking reuse (≥3 assets per project) shows the firm isn't reinventing the wheel each time – implying scalability. Method compliance ≥95% suggests a strong quality/process culture (if everyone follows the playbooks, delivery is likely consistent). While these might not appear on a typical investor checklist, they indirectly reduce execution risk and personnel cost (reusable IP makes projects more profitable). It's a forward-thinking inclusion. No external benchmark for "3 assets reused per project" – assumption, but not unreasonable (could be templates, code libraries, etc.). Similarly, "95% method compliance" is an internal QA measure – assumption but aligns with ISO/certification mindsets (do what you say you do). We mark those as company-specific, but the fact they are measured would impress an investor that this firm has a quality-focused culture.

• **Alliances** – Pipeline sourced 25–35%, OPN status green: Partners can amplify sales; if 25%+ of pipeline is partner-influenced, that's strong (we saw >30% is considered strong partner engagement⁴⁶). Investors like to see diversified pipeline generation (if direct sales falter, partners can help, and vice versa). Maintaining Oracle PartnerNetwork (OPN) status at a high tier ("green" presumably meaning all requirements met) is important for continuing to get referrals and support. These metrics show the firm isn't isolated – it has support from big ecosystem players, which can reduce go-to-market risk. So including this is valid, and earlier we cited that 25–35% partner pipeline is expected as firms scale⁴⁶.

• **Org Maturity** – Role coverage vs. stage (i.e., have you hired the key roles appropriate for your size, per section 3's headcount triggers) and OPEX within bands. These are basically ensuring that the organizational infrastructure is neither underbuilt nor overbuilt. If critical leadership roles are vacant or wearing too many hats (common in very small companies), that's a risk; by a certain size, investors want to see specialists (e.g. a real CFO when >$50M, etc.). So checking role coverage against the earlier model is smart. OPEX within bands refers to those budget % targets – an investor will benchmark the company's S&M, G&A spends against industry norms; if they are wildly off (too high = inefficiency, too low = under-investment risk), that's a concern. So scoring the company on keeping within those 15–25% overhead, etc., is directly from Section 3 and supported by benchmarks⁴⁰.

Setting 80/100 as "PE-ready" essentially means if you meet most of these metrics, you would pass a PE due diligence with flying colors. Many of these metrics and thresholds come from earlier validated content, so if a company actually hits them, 80 is achievable. It's somewhat arbitrary but not unreasonable; it's akin to saying "we need a B or better on our report card to be considered PE-grade." Given the weighting, a company could have a weakness (say alliances only score half points) but still get >80 if others are strong, which is fair.

No external publication lists an "Investor readiness index," but PE firms often use scorecards. For example, some PE due diligence checklists cover financial, commercial, operational, and legal aspects with yes/no or risk ratings. The ICRI here is a tailored operational/financial health index. It's an innovative way to quantify abstract readiness – this is an internal creation (uncited as a concept), but grounded in metrics we've validated. Notably, it gives weights emphasizing forecasting and delivery, which are indeed top priorities (rightly higher weight than, say, IP which is nice but less critical, hence 8%). The weights seem subjectively assigned but make sense. If anything, one might debate weights (e.g., should "Org maturity" be 10% or maybe more?), but that's minor.

**Commentary:** Validated (conceptually). This ICRI is a synthesis of best-practice metrics. Each component metric we find to be relevant and mostly evidence-supported. The concept of scoring them is an internal management choice – we cannot cite an external "80 means PE-ready" but we can affirm that hitting ~80% of these targets would indeed put a firm in a very strong position for PE interest. To ensure realism, one might pilot this index and see where the company currently scores. If, say, the company is at 50, it shows work needed; 80 is aspirational but that's the point. None of the dimensions are extraneous; collectively they cover growth, profitability, efficiency, diversity, and scalability – the very things a sophisticated investor examines¹. We mark the lack of external citation for the combined index itself as expected (it's a novel framework element, uncited as a whole). However, since it's built on validated parts, it stands up to scrutiny. The risk of unsupported element is low – the only caution is to ensure the weighting and scoring methodology is well-understood by management (don't obsess over a single number; use it to identify which dimension drags the score down). But as a dashboard for investor readiness, it's quite evidence-based. Key refinement could be to periodically update the target thresholds if industry standards change or if the company's context changes (for instance, in a recession, pipeline coverage might drop industry-wide, etc. – adjust targets to keep them stage-appropriate). Overall, this index is an excellent, evidence-informed summary of what "good" looks like to an investor. We consider ~90% of its content validated by prior evidence, with ~10% (the exact scoring model) being an assumption or custom approach (acceptable, since it's basically a packaging of metrics).

## 8. Stage Triggers – How Responsibilities and Percentages Change

**Draft Point:** This section describes key shifts in the operating model as the firm grows:

• **"Founder-to-System" shift:** Around $50–60M, founders/partners need to step back from day-to-day project management and most sales execution. At this stage, roles like Sales Director, PMO Lead, Resource Manager become the new centers of gravity for those functions, rather than relying on the founders. Essentially, the company must transition from informal, founder-led processes to formal roles and systems.

• **Leverage model:** Move from a senior-heavy delivery team to a pyramid structure with more juniors/analysts under seniors, to improve margins without quality loss. Target eventually a ~50/50 senior-junior mix (i.e., for every senior consultant, have a junior consultant). This improves leverage and cost efficiency.

• **Support ratio rise:** As discussed in section 3, billable headcount share will trend toward ~70% as the company scales, while support/ops grows to ~30% of headcount (which corresponds to ~15–25% of revenue cost overhead). Track ROI of overhead monthly to ensure the added support is yielding results.

• **Marketing/Sales ramp:** Willingly run Sales & Marketing expense at 12–15% of revenue in certain periods to break through growth plateaus, even if that's high, then scale it back to a steady-state ~8–12% once at ~$90M+ where organic and partner channels are stronger. In other words, accept lower short-term profitability to invest in growth, then reap efficiency later.

These are qualitative shifts with quantitative guidance, summarizing how the firm should adapt its structure and spending as it grows.

**Validation & Citations:** Each of these stage-based shifts reflects common growth challenges and solutions noted in consulting and small business growth literature:

• **Founder-to-System shift:** Many entrepreneurial companies face the inflection point where founders must delegate and install professional management. Research by HBR and others on scaling professional services emphasizes the need to reduce founder bottlenecks. For instance, Tercera (a PE firm focused on services) often notes that around the ~$50M mark, you need a robust second layer of leadership (sales head, delivery head, etc.) because the business is too large for founders to directly manage every sale or project. While we don't have a direct quote in the provided sources, this principle is widely recognized. The draft's timing (after $50M) is reasonable – at that size, the complexity requires specialized roles (and indeed the draft already queued hiring triggers around that scale, like dedicated Resource Manager, Proposal Manager, etc.). If founders do not step back by this stage, growth can stall (because everything waits for their approval or because they are stretched thin). So this is aligned with both anecdotal evidence and logic (no contradiction). We consider it validated by general business scaling theory. A McKinsey article on founder to CEO transitions might back this up, but without a direct citation, we'll rely on general agreement on this phase change.

• **Leverage model (senior/junior mix):** This is a classic consulting firm economics lever. Bringing in more junior consultants (who bill at lower rates but cost significantly less) under the guidance of expensive seniors increases gross margin while still delivering value. Many consulting firms start with mostly senior experts (especially if founder-led) but then add juniors to scale. Benchmarks: in IT services, a common leverage ratio might be 1 senior to 2–3 juniors in a mature firm. The draft's target "50/50 over time" is actually a moderate leverage (one junior per senior). That's quite plausible and even conservative compared to large consultancies that might be more leveraged (e.g. a Big4 might have 1 partner, 2-3 managers, 5-6 consultants, 5-6 analysts on a project – more juniors than seniors). But for a specialized firm, 50/50 could be fine. A ProjectWorks article (result [9] earlier) mentioned "commodity practice leverage ~8:1" for staff to experienced in some cases⁶⁴ – but that's extreme for e.g. offshore-heavy models. So there's a range. The key is: increasing leverage is a known strategy to improve margins⁶⁵. Also, as mentioned in Section 3, overhead cost needs to be controlled; using juniors is one way to keep delivery cost down as you grow. No specific cite given to us, but this is taught in consulting economics – validated by industry logic. We can say: evidence of profit margin targets for consulting (net 15–25%⁶⁵) often assumes a leveraged pyramid. Without leverage, margins stall because senior costs are high. So yes, validated concept.

• **Support ratio rise (70/30 headcount, 15–25% cost):** We already validated that overhead ~20% cost and ~30% headcount is typical at scale⁴⁰ ⁴³. Early stage being ~10% headcount overhead is also plausible (some small firms might even have 0 dedicated HR or 0 marketing – the founders do it). So as a firm grows, it must invest in support to handle complexity (finance, HR, IT, etc.), even though it dilutes the billable percentage. The draft not only accepts this but monitors ROI – that's smart because overhead can bloat without scrutiny. So this is absolutely in line with best practice: track metrics like revenue per admin or admin cost as % revenue to ensure efficiency. The numbers given we have supported earlier. Thus validated with prior sources⁶⁵ ⁴⁰ ⁴³.

• **Marketing/Sales ramp up then efficiency:** This mirrors how many companies scale: invest heavily in sales/marketing to drive growth and reach a target size, then benefit from brand, referrals, and economies to reduce relative spend. We have external context: high-growth SaaS often spend 40–50% on S&M in early years, then down to <20% when mature. In services, the range is lower (as discussed, maybe 10–15% high to 5–10% low). The draft's numbers fall in that pattern and we provided evidence for marketing spend variation³⁵ ⁶⁶. Specifically, at $90M+ returning to 8–10% S&M is plausible because by then referrals/partners (which are lower cost channels) bring more business, and the brand is established (less need for high % spend). Also, utilization and upsell might drive growth more than pure marketing. Conversely, pushing to 12–15% at $40–60M is a conscious strategy to break through the "mid-size plateau" – this is recommended by some growth advisors who say if you plateau, often the answer is to increase marketing investment (assuming market demand exists) because maybe earlier the firm was relying only on referrals (cheap but limited). So the logic is sound. It's partially validated by earlier marketing spend sources and CAC payback logic (if payback is acceptable, spending more to acquire faster is fine³³). Validated.

In summary, each trigger or strategic shift is supported either by earlier evidence or well-known industry patterns. None of these points are controversial. They describe how the company should evolve structure and spending – something investors explicitly look for management to understand. For instance, a PE firm would ask a founder, "How will you scale yourself out of day-to-day roles? Do you have the next layer of management ready?" – this addresses that. Or "How will you improve margin?" – leverage model is the answer. Or "Are you prepared to invest to grow?" – yes, run 15% S&M for a period. Or "Is your overhead in check?" – yes, we monitor overhead ROI and keep it within 15–25%. This section basically pre-empts those questions with a plan.

**Commentary:** Validated. It's a narrative explanation of earlier quantitative points, and it aligns with both those and common growth wisdom. These stage triggers are essentially bridges to the next level of maturity, and each is grounded in known issues: founder dependence, pyramid leverage, scaling overhead, and balancing growth spend. All points are supported by either direct citations already given (for the ratios) or broad consensus (for founder role changes, etc.). We don't see any unsupported or contradictory advice here. Marking where evidence was indirect: The "founder-to-system at ~$50–60M" isn't from a specific source we cited, but it's consistent with known human capital limits (there's a saying that what got you to $10M won't get you to $100M, implying structural change – this is exactly that). The leverage point we have industry data suggesting how margins and staff mix correlate. So effectively 100% of this section is either validated by earlier evidence or by widely accepted growth management principles. It's coherent with everything in the framework. We recommend little refinement, except perhaps ensuring the leadership team embraces these shifts (founders must be willing to delegate and hire ahead of the curve – sometimes a cultural challenge). But the framework calling it out is the first step.

## 9. How to Apply This – 90-Day Execution Plan

**Draft Point:** A phased 90-day implementation plan is provided to operationalize the framework.

• **Weeks 1–2 (Instrument & Assign):** Approve the Process→Owner map (assign the single "A" per process from section 1). Lock down the KPI dictionary and establish current baselines from systems (CRM, ERP, PPM). Stand up the weekly Sales Forecast meeting and Delivery/Resourcing meeting with the agendas defined (from section 5).

• **Weeks 3–6 (Fix bottlenecks):** Launch a Proposal Desk – create proposal templates, pricing guardrails, a redlines checklist, aiming to cut proposal cycle time to <15 business days. Appoint a Resource Manager; implement a 120-day forward capacity view; enforce the utilization/bench targets. Create an Alliances plan with Oracle/Kyriba partner managers: set quarterly co-sell goals, an MDF (Marketing Dev Funds) calendar, and a certification plan.

• **Weeks 7–10 (Scale repeatability):** Name a Methods/QA Lead; have them capture the 10 most-used deliverables and turn them into accelerators (e.g., scope templates, test scripts, change order forms). Implement hygiene SLAs in CRM/PPM – e.g., stage definitions must be followed, forecast categories updated, consultants enter time by next workday (WD+1). Publish Practice mini-P&Ls monthly and tie practice leader bonuses to bookings, gross margin, utilization, upsell (to drive accountability at practice level).

• **Weeks 11–13 (Prove investor-grade discipline):** Conduct the first MBR/QBR using the ICRI scorecard (Section 7). Show green/yellow/red status by each dimension and assign actions. Essentially, perform a full business review to demonstrate the new rigor and address any red flags before an investor sees them.

• **Weeks 10+) "Flex points"** (point 10 of draft) are also mentioned but likely after 90 days: areas where variation is okay (practice structure, choice of PPM tool, S&M mix bias toward alliances if working, etc.). But focus is on the 90-day execution to institutionalize the changes.

**Validation & Citations:** The plan is quite specific, but we can validate the logic and some known best practices regarding quick wins in the first 90 days of an improvement program:

The sequence makes sense: first assign ownership and measure (weeks 1–2). This aligns with the mantra "you can't improve what you don't measure"⁶⁷ ⁶⁸. By setting baselines for KPIs and establishing meeting cadences, the company creates visibility and accountability from the start. This is consistent with any performance improvement initiative – get the team on the same page with metrics and responsibilities early⁵. Also, by immediately scheduling weekly sales and delivery meetings, you kickstart the governance (which should surface issues quickly).

Next, fixing bottlenecks (weeks 3–6): The plan targets known likely weak spots – proposal turnaround, resource allocation, alliance engagement. These are smart focus areas because improvements here yield noticeable results: - A proposal desk can improve win rate and sales cycle if previously each salesperson was reinventing proposals or delays were happening. Having templates and guardrails addresses both quality and speed. Industry context: proposal quality and speed are often cited as differentiators in consulting sales (no direct source given here, but e.g. a Consulting.us article might note that faster proposals increase win probability, though we haven't cited one – it's intuitive). - Appointing a Resource Manager and using a forward capacity plan addresses the utilization/bench metrics. Many firms at ~100+ people introduce a resource management function to optimize staffing – this was signaled in section 3's triggers (≥12 projects etc.). There's evidence that better resource management can raise utilization significantly (the BigTime PSA whitepaper hinted that using PSA tools can raise utilization by 7 points⁶⁹). So this step should drive measurable improvement in billable utilization (and employee satisfaction by reducing bench uncertainty). - An Alliances plan: For Oracle partners, joint business planning with Oracle AEs and using MDF (marketing development funds) is a known best practice to get more leads from the channel. Oracle provides MDF to partners who plan events/marketing – using it can effectively lower CAC (since MDF is co-op funds). Certifications plan ensures you maintain partner tier (OPN status). This addresses the earlier KPI on alliance pipeline and cert density, so it's aligning actions to metrics.

Weeks 7–10 (Scale repeatability): - Naming a Methods/QA lead and capturing top deliverables as accelerators is essentially building the IP repository (from Section 1 process #11 "IP-to-Accelerators"). This should improve efficiency (reuse assets instead of starting from scratch). There is evidence that firms with strong knowledge management deliver projects faster and with fewer defects (for instance, a PMI paper might mention reduced rework due to templates – our evidence: draft's own target of saving time with reuse, though not externally cited). But qualitatively, if top 10 artifacts are standardized, consultants will waste less time and avoid mistakes – improving margin and quality. - Implementing hygiene SLAs in systems: This is crucial for data integrity. Many firms struggle with pipeline stages not updated (hurting forecast accuracy) or timesheets not entered promptly (hurting billing and utilization tracking). By enforcing rules like "update CRM stages" and "time in by next day," the data quality will improve, which in turn improves the KPIs (forecast accuracy, billing timeliness, etc.). It's a common initiative during operational improvements – get the basics right. (Perhaps no external citation, but it's self-evident: timely data entry = better visibility). - Publishing Practice P&Ls and tying bonuses to them: This creates accountability at the practice level (mini-business units). Consultants respond to incentives – if practice leaders have a share of profit or KPI bonuses, they will care about utilization, upsells, etc., not just revenue. PE firms often implement or increase management-by-metrics with financial incentives to drive desired outcomes (e.g., if utilization improves, margins improve, so give leaders a cut of that improvement). This is supported by general management accounting practice of responsibility centers – turning practices into quasi P&Ls fosters an ownership mindset. Also, transparency of performance (publishing the P&Ls) can create internal peer competition in a healthy way.

Weeks 11–13 (Prove discipline): Running a full MBR/QBR after ~3 months using the new ICRI scorecard is a way to simulate what an investor review might look like and ensure all metrics are trending in the right direction or at least being managed. This is effectively a dress rehearsal for due diligence. It's a great idea: any red/yellow signals can be addressed by management proactively. It is consistent with the advice that before seeking PE investment, management should perform an "internal due diligence" or health check. Using a scorecard like ICRI is the internal version of that. No external citation, but highly logical and presumably something PE advisors would recommend (to identify issues to fix before investors see them).

Overall, the 90-day plan focuses on instrumentation (metrics), quick wins (proposal speed, staffing, partnerships), building infrastructure (methods, systems discipline), and proving results (MBR with scorecard). This is a sound approach. Many integration or improvement plans use a similar breakdown: first get clarity & data, then address low-hanging fruit, then institutionalize processes, then review and adjust. The timeline (90 days) is tight but feasible for these actions since many are organizational/process changes, not requiring huge IT projects or hires (most roles are internal or can be appointed from within except maybe hiring a proposal manager or resource manager, but likely the firm might identify someone or combine roles initially).

**Commentary:** Validated (best-practice approach). This execution plan is essentially a project plan for implementing best practices, and it follows a reasonable sequence. While we can't find an academic source that "in 90 days do X, Y, Z," the steps align with widely recommended transformation practices: e.g., set up governance and metrics early⁵⁹, get some early wins to build momentum (proposal desk, etc.), institutionalize changes via tools and incentives (SLAs, bonuses), and review progress. All these are staples of change management (Kotter's 8-step change model, for example, emphasizes quick wins and anchoring new approaches in the culture – steps we see here).

No part of the plan seems unsupported or harmful. It actually hits many key improvements identified throughout the draft: by week 10, essentially all major gaps have an initiative (sales process, staffing, alliances, methods, data hygiene, accountability). The risk could be doing too much at once – but the phasing suggests a staggered approach. If anything, a refinement might be to ensure adequate resources are allocated for each initiative (e.g., who specifically will create the proposal templates in week 3 – assign that). But that's detail beyond the framework scope; presumably the team will distribute tasks.

One unsupported minor detail: "target proposal cycle <15 bd" is an internal target (the plan says launch proposal desk targeting <15 business days turnaround). We earlier flagged that as assumption (no external benchmark specifically, but very reasonable target). Not a concern, just noting it's an internal goal.

In summary, this plan is fully aligned with implementing the framework's validated pieces. It's essentially applying the evidence-backed solutions we've discussed. Therefore, this section is validated by virtue of the previous validations and known best practices in organizational change. No additional evidence needed beyond what's cited in earlier sections for the items being implemented. The plan is comprehensive for 90 days, possibly a lot to do, but if executed, it would indeed set the firm on a much stronger footing.

## 10. Flex Points (Areas for Acceptable Variation)

**Draft Point:** The framework concludes by noting where the firm can vary without harm – acknowledging that not every detail is one-size-fits-all. It mentions: Practice structure – keeping ERP/HCM/EPM/PeopleSoft/Kyriba as separate P&L "pods" is recommended, but it's flexible as long as you maintain a central PMO, Methods, and Resource Management for economies of scale. (So you could, for example, reorganize some practices or combine smaller ones, as long as the central functions remain shared). Tooling – whether you use Oracle PPM Cloud or an existing PSA tool is less important than the discipline of using it; the "brand" of software is not critical, process is. S&M mix – you can lean more on alliances (partner-sourced pipeline) versus direct marketing if that's working well (lower CAC), i.e., the go-to-market mix can vary; the key is that you hit overall pipeline and CAC targets. These are essentially areas where multiple approaches can work as long as the outcomes are achieved and principles upheld.

It also lists some evidence from the doc (presumably references to earlier benchmarks the user had in their original doc draft), which we have already covered: high-growth marketing 8–15%, billable vs support mix (~70/30 at scale), founder-led to specialized teams, leverage model juniors under seniors, PE emphasis on methods/governance/ops. These reiterate that the framework is built on known concepts (which we validated above).

**Validation & Citations:** This section is basically saying: "We've outlined a specific approach, but you have flexibility in certain non-critical choices." This is wise; it prevents dogmatism.

• **Practice structure flex:** In consulting, practice P&L structure often depends on size and leadership talent. The draft suggests keeping product-line practices (ERP, HCM, etc.) separate which is common (each practice can develop depth in their domain). But sometimes firms merge small practices or have matrix structures. By saying centralize PMO/Methods/Resourcing, the draft ensures even if practice org shifts, the critical support stays unified. This is supported by general efficiency principles: a shared PMO and resource pool avoids silos and utilization inefficiencies (if each practice had its own bench, you'd have higher overall bench than a shared pool that can deploy across practices). We saw earlier bench mgmt best practices in big firms, pointing out struggles when not managed holistically⁹. So centralizing those functions is validated by the idea of scale economies – e.g., one resource manager can handle staffing for all practices, smoothing utilization. This is essentially an operating model choice rather than an external benchmark. It seems sound: no need for citation, it's a design decision supported by logic.

• **Tooling flex:** This is absolutely true in practice. Whether the firm uses Oracle's own PPM or a third-party PSA (like FinancialForce, Kimble, etc.) is less important than actually having a system and using it consistently. The draft wisely says "discipline matters more than brand." This aligns with our earlier discussion: a good process can be executed on various platforms, but a tool alone won't fix a bad process⁷⁰ ⁷¹. Provided the tool captures needed data (utilization, project status, etc.), the name doesn't matter. Many firms agonize over tool selection; the draft implies don't let that derail you – use what you have effectively. This sentiment is echoed by consultants often: e.g., "the best PSA tool is the one you actually use" (common refrain, though we haven't a specific cite, it's widely acknowledged in IT circles that process adherence outweighs software features).

• **S&M mix flex:** The framework earlier gave ranges for marketing-influenced vs partner-sourced pipeline. Here it says you can skew more to alliances if that's yielding cheaper pipeline (which often it does, as partners bring leads at lower direct cost). This acknowledges that some firms might have 25% partner-sourced pipeline, others 50%, depending on how strong the channel is. Both can be fine as long as total pipeline is healthy and CAC payback is in range. This is consistent with our earlier validation that partner contribution >25% is good⁴⁶; if a firm can get even more from partners, great (just ensure not to neglect direct marketing if needed). So basically allocate marketing dollars to where you see best ROI – which is what any agile marketing strategy would do (if alliances yield high ROI leads, invest more there, etc.). So this is validated by the principle of optimizing customer acquisition cost across channels – a fundamental marketing strategy concept (e.g., monitor which channel has lower CAC or better conversion and adjust spend).

Thus, the flex points are all rational allowances: They don't undermine the framework outcomes, they just give room for tailoring. There's no rigid mandate on org chart beyond what's necessary, no dogma on software, and adaptive go-to-market – all good.

**Commentary:** Validated. This section doesn't introduce new metrics or prescriptions; it provides sensible flexibility. Each point aligns with a pragmatic understanding that companies differ. By highlighting them, the framework avoids being too cookie-cutter. It shows an investor that management is thoughtful and not dogmatic – they care about results, not form. This is actually likely to increase investor confidence because it shows adaptability.

No evidence needed beyond what we've discussed: it's more of a guidance note. We've already validated the underlying ideas (marketing spend, overhead, etc.). The flex points themselves are essentially tips. They don't conflict with best practice; they actually are best practice to be flexible in those areas. No unsupported content here. We fully agree: Focus on fundamentals (process, metrics), not trivialities (exact org or tool brand) – that's a sentiment echoed in operations management (e.g., Deming's quality principles focus on process, not blame/tools).

So, this final point is consistent and validated by the broader evidence base we've covered.

------

## Summary Dashboard:

• **Validated Points:** Approximately 90% of the framework's content is validated by credible evidence or widely accepted best practices. We have cited benchmarks or authoritative sources for most key metrics (utilization, conversion rates, win rates, CAC, DSO, overhead ratios, etc.) and practices (single process owners, weekly reviews, scaling stages, etc.). Nearly all major recommendations (from KPI targets to structural changes) align with known successful patterns in the industry²⁷ ⁴⁰.

• **Points Needing Evidence or Marked as Assumptions:** Roughly 10% of the points are unsupported by external sources and based on internal hypotheses or experience. These include a few specific targets like "red project recovery in <2 weeks", "change-order capture 80%", certain hiring trigger thresholds, and the ICRI composite scoring method. They are sensible assumptions but lack direct benchmark data. We flagged these as "uncited / assumption" in the analysis. They do not contradict best practices, but their exact values are framework-specific. The risk of using these unsupported elements is low, but if treated inflexibly they could mislead (e.g., focusing on a 2-week recovery window without context). However, they mostly serve as internal goals to strive for excellence. We recommend monitoring these and adjusting if needed (e.g., if 80% CO capture is too high or easily exceeded, tune the target over time).

• **Key Refinements Recommended:**

- Provide References for Internal Targets: For any metric marked as assumption (e.g., change-order capture), either back it with internal historical data (what was it before?) or industry anecdotes, or clarify it's a stretch goal. This helps team buy-in.
- Review Weightings in ICRI: Ensure the weighted scores truly reflect the firm's strategic priorities. For instance, if method compliance (8% weight) is less critical than, say, pipeline health, you've done that by weighting, but validate weights periodically. Possibly involve an outside advisor to sanity-check the index.
- Stagger Implementation to Absorb Change: The 90-day plan is aggressive. We suggest ensuring adequate resources for each initiative. If any step slips, extend that phase rather than rush – better to fully realize a change than to half-implement many. The framework could note "if constrained, prioritize steps that yield the biggest confidence boost (likely forecasting, financial controls, and delivery quality)."
- Leverage External Benchmarks Continuously: Now that baselines are set, management should continuously compare its KPI outcomes to industry benchmarks (many of which we cited) to ensure targets remain competitive. Join industry benchmarking surveys (e.g., SPI Research PS Benchmark) for ongoing validation.
- Communicate and Train: A refinement is to add a change management element – ensure all leaders understand their scorecards and have training or support to hit their KPIs. The framework is only as good as its execution by people. This might include workshops in Week 1–2 to educate the team on new processes and expectations.
- Monitor Flex vs. Rigor: While flex points allow variation, maintain rigor on the non-negotiables (e.g., one accountable owner per process, tracking KPIs weekly). We recommend explicitly listing which elements are mandates versus flexible, so everyone knows where they can innovate and where conformity is required. This will prevent any misinterpretation that everything is flexible.
- Document and Iterate: After the first QBR using the new system (Week 11–13), take feedback and refine the framework. Perhaps the ICRI weightings get tweaked or a new KPI is added if something was missing. The framework should evolve as a living investor-grade playbook.

By implementing these refinements, the framework will be even more evidence-based and investor-grade, with clear distinctions between proven benchmarks and internal targets. The end result is a playbook that not only matches consulting industry best practices but is also tailored to the firm's unique context and growth ambitions, thereby maximizing predictable profitability, PE readiness, and scalable operations.

# Structuring an Oracle Cloud Consulting Firm for Growth and Profitability

Growing a consulting firm (focused on Oracle Cloud SaaS ERP/HCM/EPM, PeopleSoft, and Kyriba implementations) from ~$33–39M toward a larger scale requires carefully defining your core business processes and aligning them with the right roles. Every successful consulting firm needs to execute certain key processes excellently to drive growth and profitability. Below, we outline these critical business processes, map them to specific roles/responsibilities, and discuss how the emphasis (and resource allocation) for each role shifts as the firm scales (including considerations for private-equity-backed "massive growth").

## Key Business Processes for a Successful Consulting Firm

Every growing consulting firm should master a set of fundamental business processes to ensure sustainable growth and profits. These processes include both client-facing activities (winning and delivering work) and internal operations (managing people, finances, and strategy). The major processes are:

### Strategic Planning & Leadership
Define a clear business strategy and growth plan, driven by the leadership team. This involves setting the firm's vision, market focus, and long-term goals, which in turn drive future performance¹. Effective strategic planning ensures the firm targets the right markets and offerings and can inspire confidence in investors or stakeholders that growth objectives are achievable¹. Leadership must regularly review and adjust strategy, especially under private equity (PE) ownership where aggressive growth targets are common.

### Marketing & Lead Generation
Proactively generate brand awareness and inbound leads. Marketing tasks include creating thought leadership content (blog posts, whitepapers), managing digital marketing (website, SEO, social media), organizing events or webinars, and showcasing the firm's expertise in Oracle Cloud solutions. The goal is to demonstrate expertise and create brand awareness – for example, by publishing research or hosting conferences – in order to generate leads for the sales team². High-growth professional services firms tend to invest heavily in marketing (often dedicating 8–15% of revenue to it), recognizing that more marketing spend yields more leads and faster growth³. In short, a mature marketing process consistently fills the top of the sales funnel with qualified opportunities.

### Sales & Business Development
Convert leads and opportunities into signed clients/projects. This process involves networking, relationship-building, crafting proposals, and closing deals. In consulting, sales is often relationship-driven – senior members (like partners or the founder) play a major role in winning work through their industry contacts and credibility⁴. However, as the firm grows, establishing a repeatable business development process (prospecting, pipeline management, formal proposals) becomes crucial. Successful firms ensure there is dedicated focus on sales activities to maintain a steady flow of new business⁵. This may include managing partnerships (e.g. with Oracle or other software vendors) to source leads. Business development processes should be structured yet remain consultative, addressing client needs to win trust.

### Client Relationship Management
Nurture long-term relationships with clients and ensure high client satisfaction. Because consulting is often a relationship business, key account management is critical – maintaining strong, senior-level client relationships leads to repeat business and references⁶. Successful firms put processes in place to regularly communicate with past and current clients, measure satisfaction, and identify opportunities to upsell or cross-sell (for example, an ERP implementation client might later need HCM or EPM services). Diversifying the client base is also important (to avoid over-reliance on a few clients)⁶. In practice, partners or account managers oversee client relationships, ensuring issues are addressed and new needs are met. This process contributes directly to growth (via extensions and referrals) and stability of revenue.

### Service Delivery & Project Management
Deliver high-quality consulting projects efficiently and predictably. This encompasses the entire project delivery lifecycle – scoping and planning projects, assembling the right team, executing the implementation/configuration work, and managing timelines, scope, and budget. Strong project management and delivery processes ensure projects are completed successfully (on time, on budget, meeting client expectations) which safeguards profitability and reputation. As firms grow, they formalize methodologies (e.g. Oracle implementation best practices), quality assurance checks, and knowledge capture from projects. Effective delivery also involves leveraging technology and tools to improve consistency⁷. In essence, "the better service delivery is managed" – with standardized methods and tools – the more confidence clients (and investors) have in the firm's ability to scale⁷. Delivery excellence is especially crucial in PE-backed growth scenarios, where maintaining quality while taking on more projects is a key challenge.

### Financial Management & Operations
Keep the business financially healthy and running smoothly. This includes budgeting, accounting, and financial control (e.g. tracking project profitability, managing cash flow, and analyzing key metrics like utilization and billable rates). Back-office operations also cover contract management, legal compliance, and IT systems for internal use. A robust operations process means having clear management reporting and controls to ensure that as revenue grows, margins are maintained and risks are managed⁸. Investors and PE owners pay close attention to this: reliable forecasting and financial oversight give confidence that growth is sustainable⁸. Additionally, efficient operations entail optimizing internal processes (such as time-tracking, resource allocation, and knowledge management) to support a larger scale. Essentially, the firm needs an operational backbone that can "deliver a smooth upward gradient" of revenue and EBITDA growth⁹ – meaning scalable systems and processes that won't break under higher volume.

### Talent Acquisition & Development (HR)
Recruit, retain, and develop the consulting talent needed to execute projects and grow the firm. In a consulting business, people are the product – so having strong HR processes is non-negotiable. This includes workforce planning, recruiting top talent (especially in niche areas like Oracle Cloud and PeopleSoft), onboarding and training, performance management, and creating career paths to retain high performers. Demonstrating effective people processes is critical, since buyers/investors want to see that the firm can "recruit, retain and develop the talent needed to deliver future growth"¹⁰. At a smaller scale, hiring is often opportunistic, but as the firm grows, a systematic approach to staffing is needed (e.g. campus recruiting for junior consultants, formal training programs for new hires, and leadership development for rising managers). A culture that supports continuous learning (obtaining Oracle certifications, etc.) and employee engagement will improve delivery quality and reduce turnover. In a high-growth environment, scaling headcount without diluting quality is a major challenge, making the HR function strategically important.

### Service Offering Development & Partnerships
Continuously refine and expand the firm's service offerings while managing key partnerships. For an Oracle-focused consultancy, this means staying at the forefront of Oracle Cloud product updates, developing proprietary implementation methodologies or accelerators, and possibly expanding into complementary areas (e.g. adding a new cloud module expertise or related software like Kyriba for treasury). Strong firms invest in their market proposition and intellectual property (IP) – ensuring the services are well-differentiated and repeatable¹¹. This might involve creating templates, solution accelerators, or industry-specific solutions that improve delivery speed and margins. Additionally, maintaining a good partnership with Oracle (and other vendors like Kyriba) is key for go-to-market; tasks here include obtaining and keeping partner certifications, co-marketing with the vendor, and leveraging their sales channels. A firm that regularly updates its offerings and deepens its expertise will stay competitive and command premium pricing. (Notably, Equiteq's research highlights that a differentiated market proposition with supporting IP can "drive up margins" and scale effectively¹².)

Each of these processes works together to drive growth. In summary, strategy sets the direction, marketing and sales bring in business, delivery and client management ensure successful projects and repeat revenue, and operations, finance, and HR enable the firm to execute efficiently and sustainably. Next, we map these processes to concrete roles in the organization.

## Mapping Processes to Organizational Roles and Responsibilities

As a firm grows from a boutique into a larger organization, it needs clearly defined roles to own each of the above processes. Below are the key roles in a consulting firm and how their responsibilities map to those critical business tasks:

### Chief Executive Officer (CEO) / Founder
The CEO or managing partner is the visionary leader responsible for overall strategy, culture, and performance. This role sets the firm's strategic direction and ensures all key processes are aligned with that vision. Primary tasks of the CEO include defining growth strategy and service offerings, making major sales/business development efforts, keeping an eye on financial health, and building the leadership team¹³. In a smaller firm, the founder often wears multiple hats – for example, the CEO might personally handle the majority of sales and client relationship management early on¹⁴. As the firm expands, the CEO shifts more to high-level leadership and strategic growth tasks (e.g. forging new partnerships, evaluating acquisitions, guiding the company through PE-driven expansion) and delegates day-to-day functions to department heads. The CEO remains ultimately accountable for profitability and must ensure that all the pieces (sales, delivery, operations, etc.) come together to meet growth targets.

### Senior Partners / Directors
In many consulting firms, especially those that have grown beyond the boutique stage, you have a tier of senior leaders (often equity partners or directors) just below the CEO. Senior Partners act as a strategic council – they contribute to firm strategy, mentor other leaders, and often focus on high-level relationship building and thought leadership¹⁵. They typically hold ownership stakes and have extensive experience. Partners/Practice Directors (the next tier) serve as the bridge between top-level strategy and execution. They often own a book of business or a practice area (e.g. one partner might lead the Oracle ERP practice, another heads HCM, etc.), making sure their service line meets its sales and delivery goals. Partners are heavily involved in client relationships and oversight of projects in their domain, ensuring quality outcomes. They also spend significant time on business development, leveraging their expertise and networks to win new deals¹⁶. In short, partners and practice leaders are accountable for both selling work and delivering it: they translate the firm's strategy into practice-specific plans, manage key client accounts, and guide project teams to success.

### Chief Operating Officer (COO) / Operations Manager
As a firm grows, a COO or similar operations leader is often introduced to take charge of internal execution and scalability. The COO's role is to ensure the business runs smoothly day-to-day. This includes overseeing project delivery processes, resource allocation across projects, internal process improvements, and often managing administrative functions. In a boutique's early days, this role might be informal or combined with another job, but by the time the firm is mid-sized, having a person dedicated to operations can greatly improve efficiency. The operations manager focuses on internal processes, making sure that as new projects start, the right people are assigned and systems are in place¹⁷. They might implement project management tools, standardize methodologies, and monitor KPIs like utilization or project margins. Essentially, the COO frees the CEO to focus on strategy by "keeping the trains running on time" – ensuring that all support functions (IT, facilities, etc.) and project operations are coordinated.

### Marketing & Content Specialist / Marketing Manager
This role (or team, as the firm grows) owns the Marketing & Lead Generation process. Responsibilities include creating marketing campaigns, managing the company's online presence, producing content that showcases expertise (case studies, blogs, conference presentations), and executing strategies to attract new client leads. A marketing manager works to increase brand visibility and demonstrate the firm's thought leadership, which in turn generates leads for the sales/business development team². Early on, the "marketing department" might be a single versatile specialist (or the duty of a partner/founder part-time). As the firm grows, this expands into a team possibly including roles like a content writer, digital marketer, and event coordinator. The marketing function also often tracks market trends and advises leadership on service positioning (high-growth firms have marketing get involved in "researching markets [and] implementing strategy", not just basic promotion¹⁸). In terms of deliverables, marketing is responsible for a healthy pipeline of qualified leads, a strong brand reputation in the Oracle consulting space, and supporting sales with collateral and campaigns.

### Sales / Business Development Lead
This role focuses on Sales & Business Development – turning leads into revenue. In a young firm, the founder or partners typically perform this function (leveraging industry relationships to win projects)⁴. Over time, especially after a PE acquisition when aggressive growth is expected, the firm might hire dedicated sales executives or a BD Director. Responsibilities include managing the sales pipeline, meeting prospective clients, crafting proposals/quotes, and closing deals. They work closely with marketing on lead follow-up and with delivery teams to scope projects accurately. Because consulting sales are relationship-heavy, senior leaders remain involved – but having a structured sales process and team ensures no opportunities fall through the cracks. The sales lead also coordinates any partnership-driven sales (for instance, liaising with Oracle's sales organization for joint opportunities). In summary, this role is accountable for hitting revenue targets by consistently bringing in new business and expanding existing accounts. It's worth noting that in consulting, partners at all levels remain involved in business development due to the trust-based nature of winning consulting work⁴ – so the Sales Lead often works as an enabler and coordinator for the partner team's BD efforts, providing tools, CRM tracking, and support to make selling more systematic.

### Project Managers / Engagement Managers
Project managers take charge once a deal is signed and a project kicks off. They oversee day-to-day execution of consulting projects, managing scope, timeline, resources, and client communications for each engagement¹⁷. A project manager's tasks include creating project plans, coordinating the consulting team's activities, monitoring progress against milestones, and handling any issues or change requests. Their goal is to ensure successful project delivery and client satisfaction while also protecting the firm's commercial interests (preventing scope creep, hitting budget targets). In smaller firms, senior consultants or the partners themselves might fulfill the project management role for each project. As the firm grows, dedicated project managers (possibly organized in a Project Management Office, PMO) are brought in, especially for large and complex Oracle implementation programs. This specialization allows for more consistent delivery. Operations managers vs. project managers: sometimes a COO/operations manager focuses on overall firm operations, whereas project managers focus on individual client projects¹⁷. Both roles are crucial – project managers make sure each engagement is on track, while the ops lead ensures the portfolio of projects and internal processes run well.

### Consultants and Analysts (Delivery Team)
These are the professionals (senior consultants, junior consultants, business analysts, solution architects, etc.) who actually deliver the consulting services. They map to the Service Delivery process – configuring Oracle Cloud modules, designing solutions, conducting analyses, and providing expert advice to clients. Senior consultants often lead workstreams or act as subject-matter experts (for example, a senior HCM consultant leading the Core HR module implementation), while junior consultants/analysts handle data gathering, documentation, testing, and analysis under guidance. In a typical project team hierarchy, consultants do the heavy analytical and technical work, prepare deliverables, and contribute recommendations, while reporting to project managers or partners¹⁹. Their responsibility is to produce high-quality work that meets client requirements and to adapt the firm's methodology to the client's situation. In a smaller firm, most consultants are experienced generalists (since boutiques tend to have a higher percentage of senior experts directly involved²⁰). As the firm grows, it usually hires more junior consultants to leverage senior staff – larger consulting firms often have a "pyramid" structure where partners supervise managers, who oversee juniors; seniors win the work, and less experienced analysts assist with delivery²¹. Regardless of level, all consultants are expected to maintain high utilization (billable hours) and keep their skills (and certifications) up-to-date. In our context, that means continuous training on new Oracle Cloud features or emerging modules (like new EPM tools or updates in PeopleSoft) to ensure the team's expertise remains cutting-edge.

### Finance Manager / Controller (and eventually CFO)
This role handles Financial Management & Operations tasks on the back end. A finance manager or controller is responsible for accounting (books and records), financial reporting, budgeting, payroll, billing clients, and managing expenses. They ensure that invoices are sent and collected, vendor bills are paid, and the firm's cash flow is healthy. They also work on financial analysis – e.g. tracking project profitability, utilization rates, and advising leadership on pricing or cost management. As the firm grows (especially under PE ownership), having a strategic Chief Financial Officer (CFO) becomes important. The CFO would take a higher-level view: providing forecasts, performing financial planning & analysis, and guiding decisions to improve profitability and valuation. In early stages, many firms outsource parts of finance or use external accountants, but as complexity increases, internal finance capability is needed²². Finance also covers legal and contract management aspects – reviewing client contracts, ensuring compliance, and coordinating with external legal counsel when necessary²². In summary, the finance role's responsibility is to keep the company's financial engine running smoothly and advise leadership on financial strategy. This includes maintaining KPIs dashboards for the business and making sure the firm meets targets (margin, revenue, cash) set out in the strategic plan.

### Human Resources (HR) Manager
The HR role is in charge of the Talent Acquisition & Development process. An HR manager (or HR director in a larger firm) handles recruiting new consultants (which involves everything from employer branding to interviewing and onboarding) and developing existing staff (performance evaluations, training programs, mentorship initiatives). In a small consulting firm, formal HR might be minimal – often the partners or an admin handle hiring and HR tasks alongside other duties²³. But as you scale up, a professional HR function is needed to compete in the "war for talent." In a larger firm, HR becomes a strategic department focused not just on hiring, but also on retention strategies, career path design, and ensuring a good workplace culture²⁴. For example, the HR team might implement consultant training on the latest Oracle releases, or organize knowledge-sharing sessions across practice areas. They also ensure compliance with employment laws and manage benefits/compensation structures that attract and keep top talent. Ultimately, the HR manager's responsibility is to make sure the firm has the right people capacity and skills at all times to deliver on projects and growth plans. This role grows in importance with scale: small missteps in hiring or high turnover can severely constrain a growing consulting firm, so HR provides the processes and attention to mitigate that.

### Administrative Support
These roles include executive assistants, office managers, and other support staff who handle administrative tasks to keep the business running smoothly. Responsibilities cover scheduling meetings, coordinating travel, processing paperwork, and generally reducing the administrative burden on consultants and executives. Often early on, a single administrative assistant might handle a broad range of support duties (and sometimes also help with bookkeeping or basic marketing coordination)²⁵ ²⁶. As the firm grows, you might have multiple admins or specialized support roles (for instance, a dedicated proposal coordinator to assist the sales team, or a project coordinator supporting project managers). While these roles are not client-facing, they are vital for efficiency – they free up billable staff to focus on high-value activities. For example, an executive assistant managing a CEO's calendar or a project coordinator preparing status reports can significantly enhance the productivity of those roles. In terms of process mapping: admin staff contribute to operations (internal coordination) and often support marketing, sales, and delivery by handling logistical and documentation tasks²⁷.

*(Note: In practice, the organizational chart of a firm will also reflect these roles. A typical mid-sized consulting firm might have a leadership layer (CEO and perhaps a few senior partners or VPs), a middle layer of managers (e.g. practice leaders, project managers, department heads for marketing/HR/finance), and the frontline consultants and staff. In an Oracle-focused firm with multiple service lines, you may organize by Practice: e.g. a Practice Lead for ERP, another for HCM, etc., each responsible for both sales and delivery in their area. Those practice leads in turn work with the functional heads (marketing, HR, etc.) to ensure firm-wide consistency. The exact titles can vary, but the functions remain similar to what's described above.)*

By clearly assigning these roles and their accompanying responsibilities, the firm can ensure each key business process has an "owner." One common pitfall to avoid is having vague or overlapping roles as you grow – when "everyone does a little of everything," accountability suffers and things fall through the cracks²⁸. Instead, define clear roles early, even if individuals wear multiple hats, so that as you expand you can seamlessly hand off duties to new team members in each area.

## Resource Allocation and How Roles Evolve with Growth

The balance of roles and the percentage of effort or headcount in each function will shift as your consulting firm grows. In the early stages (small or "boutique" consulting firms), the vast majority of the team is billable consultants working on client projects, with minimal dedicated overhead staff. As the firm scales up (especially into the $50M+ range and beyond), you will invest more in support functions like marketing, sales, and operations to enable further growth. Below, we outline how role distribution and focus typically change from a boutique phase into a larger, more mature firm:

### Headcount Mix – Billable vs. Support
Smaller consulting firms operate very lean. It's not unusual in a boutique firm for nearly everyone to be client-facing, generating revenue directly²⁹. For example, a boutique of ~10 people might have 8-9 consultants and only 1-2 in support roles (perhaps a part-time bookkeeper and a marketing assistant). In the Consulting Success example, a "typical boutique" team of under 10 people had just one marketing/content person and one admin, with the rest all consultants (including the founder)²⁶. This means roughly 80–90% of staff were billable. As firms grow larger, they add more non-billable roles to scale operations. In a larger consulting firm, the consultant cadre might be around 70% of the workforce, supplemented by ~30% support and administrative staff³⁰. In other words, the proportion of overhead personnel tends to rise with company size (though it usually remains well under 50%). Industry benchmarks show professional consulting firms often have overhead (non-client-facing) costs in the range of ~15–25% of revenue, reflecting this balance³¹. The key is to add necessary support roles to enable growth, but manage overhead carefully so profitability is maintained. Private equity owners will expect you to invest in scaling infrastructure (people and systems) but also watch that these investments deliver a return in growth.

### Marketing & Sales Investment
In the very early days, dedicated marketing and sales roles are minimal – founders and senior consultants rely on personal networks and referrals for business, doing marketing in ad-hoc ways. For instance, the CEO may handle most sales efforts initially (on top of delivery duties) and only later bring on a marketing specialist or salesperson¹⁴. However, to break through growth plateaus, the firm must increase investment in marketing and business development. Research indicates that average firms spend around 8–15% of revenue on marketing, and high-growth firms spend even more (often at the upper end of that range)³. As your firm grows from ~$30M toward $50M+ in revenue, you should expect to allocate a greater percentage of your budget and headcount to marketing and sales. Practically, this means hiring more marketing personnel (or engaging agencies) to amplify lead generation, and hiring dedicated sales or account executives to pursue new clients. For example, what might start as one part-time marketing coordinator could evolve into a small team (content marketing, digital marketing, events) by the time you are, say, a 100-person company. The marketing team's role broadens as well – in high-growth firms, marketing isn't just doing brochures; they get involved in market research, strategy, even service development and talent branding¹⁸. Similarly, the sales function may evolve from one or two partners selling to a structured team with a VP of Sales, a couple of business development managers, and perhaps junior sales support. This expanded focus on marketing and sales is essential to sustain higher growth rates – as organic referrals will no longer suffice to hit ambitious targets.

### Leadership and Management Structure
In a small firm, management is very flat – the founder/CEO directly oversees most activity (sales, delivery, operations). As you grow, new layers of management are introduced to maintain control and efficiency. For instance, when projects and staff multiply, you appoint project managers to handle day-to-day project oversight instead of the partners doing it all themselves³² ³³. You may establish practice leaders for each major service line (Oracle ERP, HCM, etc.) to manage those teams and take P&L responsibility for their area. The founder gradually offloads certain responsibilities: first project delivery, then project management, then sales, and eventually even overall operational management, as described in the "stages" of consulting growth³⁴ ³³. By the time the firm is, say, $100M in revenue, the CEO should be focused on high-level strategy, key client relationships, and possibly M&A opportunities, rather than any operational tasks. At that stage, a full leadership team (COO, CFO, heads of Sales, Marketing, HR, Practice VPs) is in place to handle functional management. Each of those leaders brings more specialized experience (often PE investors will encourage hiring seasoned executives for these roles to drive growth). This does mean a higher portion of payroll goes to senior management, but it's necessary to coordinate a larger enterprise. One caution: ensure that delegating responsibilities goes hand-in-hand with strong communication and clear goals – new managers must understand the growth objectives and be accountable for their share (e.g. the marketing director is accountable for lead volume, the delivery director for utilization and client satisfaction, etc.).

### Processes Maturing (from Informal to Formal)
With growth, the maturity of processes increases. Early on, processes are often informal or driven by individual heroics – e.g. sales is based on the founder's personal approach, project management might rely on a few star consultants. As you scale, you standardize and document processes so they are repeatable by the larger team. This goes hand-in-hand with roles specialization. For example, initially, partners might individually decide how to execute projects, but later the firm might adopt a standard project delivery methodology for Oracle implementations that all project managers follow. Similarly, HR might introduce formal training programs and performance review cycles instead of ad-hoc mentoring. This maturation is crucial: it reduces dependency on specific people and allows the company to maintain quality and efficiency as headcount grows. However, formal processes also require oversight – hence roles like a Quality Manager or PMO lead might appear at larger scale to enforce standards. Knowledge management becomes a dedicated effort: at a certain size, you may designate a knowledge manager or invest in collaboration tools so that each project's learnings are captured and shared (preventing "reinventing the wheel" every time). PE-backed firms often place strong emphasis on such infrastructure, because these investors want to see scalable, well-governed operations⁹.

### Change in Staff Composition – Senior vs. Junior Mix
The leverage model in consulting tends to shift with size. Boutiques often have a high proportion of senior experts (since reputation and quality are their initial selling point)²⁰. As workload grows, they start hiring more junior consultants to increase delivery capacity and improve margin (juniors have lower cost and can handle routine work, freeing seniors for high-value tasks). Larger firms thus resemble a pyramid: a few senior directors/partners at the top, supported by a larger base of junior and mid-level consultants. This doesn't mean cutting all senior hiring – rather, seniors focus on oversight and client management while juniors/analysts handle analyses and configurations¹⁹. For your firm, currently around $39M, you might still have a relatively senior-heavy team (especially if many hires were experienced Oracle consultants to establish credibility). As you aim for massive growth, plan to broaden the base: recruit and train junior consultants (maybe university grads or early-career professionals) who can be mentored by your seniors. This will allow you to take on more projects cost-effectively. Of course, balancing this is key – too many juniors without proper training can affect quality, but too few juniors means seniors get stretched thin doing basic tasks. The transition should be gradual and accompanied by solid training programs (again highlighting HR's role in development). Over time, your staff mix might go from, say, 80% senior/20% junior at $30M to perhaps 50% senior/50% junior at a much higher revenue, with intermediate managers in between. This is exactly how large consulting firms maintain profitability: senior people win the business, then a portion of delivery is handled by less experienced staff under supervision²¹. Embracing an appropriate leverage model will be important under PE pressure to improve margins while scaling.

### Greater Emphasis on Specialized Roles
In a small firm, one person may handle multiple functions – for example, a single operations/admin person might do bookkeeping, HR paperwork, and office management. As the firm expands, roles become more specialized. We've touched on this with marketing and sales, but it applies across all support areas. For instance, you might split the finance role into an AR/AP accountant and a financial analyst as volume grows. Or have a dedicated Recruiter within HR solely focused on hiring the dozens of new consultants needed per year during high growth. Another example is IT support – at first, consultants might manage their own software setups, but later you might need an IT systems administrator or a small IT team to manage tools (especially if you deploy internal systems or client data environments). The point of inflection is often when the current staff can no longer comfortably juggle the increasing workload of a function. PE investors sometimes proactively encourage adding these specialized roles early to prevent bottlenecks. A good practice is to monitor if any team member is consistently overextended on non-core tasks – e.g. if your consultants are spending too much time on admin or if the operations manager is drowning in HR work, it's probably time to hire an HR manager or additional admin support. By the time you reach perhaps 200+ employees, expect each major function (Finance, HR, Marketing, IT, Legal) to have at least one dedicated leader/manager and possibly a small team.

### Maintaining Profitability During Growth
One last consideration is how the financial profile changes as you invest in these roles. Adding marketing, sales, and other overhead roles will increase operating expenses, which can lower short-term profit margins per project or overall³⁵ ³⁶. This is a normal part of scaling – for example, hiring a full-time marketing team is an upfront cost that should pay off in more revenue later. Successful firms manage this by setting target ratios and monitoring ROI of each function. For instance, you might decide that sales & marketing expense should be, say, 15% of revenue when scaling (up from maybe 5% when you were smaller), with the expectation that this investment drives 20%+ annual growth. High-growth firms deliberately spend more on sales/marketing and reap higher growth and profitability in return³⁷ ³⁸. The key is to keep an eye on these percentages: if overhead grows faster than revenue for too long, margins suffer. In a PE-backed situation, you'll likely have aggressive growth targets, and hitting them will justify the increased overhead. But you should also continuously improve efficiency in each department (for example, using automation tools in marketing or standardized templates in project delivery to do more with the same number of people). Over time, economies of scale can kick in – certain overhead costs won't need to grow linearly with revenue. For instance, a solid finance system can handle double the invoices with only a small addition to staff. Thus, as roles specialize and processes standardize, productivity per support staff can improve, helping profitability rebound. It's a balancing act: invest enough in people and process to scale, but not so much that it outpaces growth. Tracking metrics like revenue per employee, overhead ratio, and consultant utilization will inform if your role allocation is on track.

## Summary

The evolution from a $30M boutique to a larger $50M+ firm involves moving from an informal, founder-centric operation to a structured, department-driven organization. Early on, a few people juggle many roles; later, each key business process is handled by dedicated professionals or teams, and the firm's resources (headcount and budget) are more evenly distributed across functions like marketing, sales, HR, and delivery. The percentages of personnel in non-billable roles will rise moderately – but this is a necessary investment to enable growth. The most important factor is that roles and responsibilities keep pace with the firm's growth: as you bring in more revenue and projects, proactively introduce the right roles (and processes) at the right time. A private equity acquisition usually accelerates this need, since massive growth goals demand a highly competent management team and scalable operations from the start. By understanding these evolving demands, you can reorganize your Oracle consulting firm in a way that not only handles growth but actually propels it – with each business function contributing effectively to the firm's success.

# An Investor-Grade Operational Framework: Validation, Benchmarking, and Refinement for a Professional Services Firm





## Executive Summary: Validating the Operational Blueprint for Scalable Growth and Investor Readiness



This report provides a comprehensive validation and refinement of the draft operational framework for a professional services organization (PSO). The objective is to analyze the proposed processes, key performance indicators (KPIs), governance structures, and organizational design against authoritative industry benchmarks and private equity (PE) due diligence standards. The result is an evidence-based, investor-grade operational model engineered to deliver predictable profitability, support scalable growth, and withstand the rigors of third-party scrutiny.

The core finding of this analysis is that the draft framework presents a solid and comprehensive structure, touching upon the critical value-chain processes of a modern PSO. However, its transformation from an internal guide into a strategic asset hinges on the systematic integration of evidence-based metrics, the adoption of mature process disciplines, and the explicit linkage of operational activities to financial outcomes. The most critical refinement suggested is the evolution from a process-centric view to a maturity-centric one. A potential investor is not merely acquiring a set of procedures; they are investing in a firm's demonstrated *capability* to execute predictably and scale profitably. This capability is the essence of operational maturity, which has a proven, quantifiable impact on financial performance.1 High-maturity PSOs consistently report significantly higher profit margins—as much as 265% higher for the most mature firms compared to their less-developed peers—and superior revenue growth.1

The following table provides a high-level summary of the most critical KPIs discussed in this report, comparing the draft's proposed targets against benchmark ranges from multiple authoritative sources. This comparison immediately highlights areas of ambitious goal-setting and potential gaps relative to industry norms.

| KPI                               | Draft Target (Illustrative) | Benchmark Range - Source 1                                   | Benchmark Range - Source 2                           | Benchmark Range - Source 3                    | Commentary                                                   |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Billable Utilization (Consultant) | 80%                         | **SPI Research:**68.9% (2024 Avg), 75% (Optimal Threshold) 2 | **Projectworks:**80-85% ('Procedure' firms) 4        | **Mosaic.tech:**70-80% (Ideal Range) 5        | The draft target is aggressive compared to the recent industry average but aligns with benchmarks for high-performing, procedure-oriented firms. |
| Project Gross Margin              | 40%                         | **SPI Research:**35.9% (2024 Avg) 2                          | **ScopeStack:**50-70% (IT Services) 6                | **Projectworks:**20-35% ('Procedure' firms) 4 | The target is achievable but requires strong cost control. It is below the ideal for IT services but above the average for general consulting. |
| Proposal Win Rate (New Business)  | 50%                         | **QorusDocs:**40% (Median) 7                                 | **Loopio:** 45% (Avg) 8                              | **Dimensionless:**50-60% (Target) 9           | The target aligns with the higher end of industry averages and best-practice goals, indicating a need for a highly effective qualification and proposal process. |
| CAC Payback Period                | 12 months                   | **Benchmarkit:**14-18 months (SaaS Median) 10                | **Stripe:** <12 months (Healthy for SaaS) 11         | **Uncited / Assumption**                      | A target of 12 months is considered excellent and demonstrates high capital efficiency, a key focus for investors. |
| DSO (Days Sales Outstanding)      | 45 days                     | **Emagia:** 30-60 days (Professional Services) 12            | **APQC/CFO Mag:** 36 days (Cross-Industry Median) 13 | **Investopedia:**<45 days (Generally Good) 14 | The target is well within the industry standard and represents a healthy cash conversion cycle. |

Key recommendations focus on three areas: first, formalizing a knowledge management strategy to systematically capture and leverage reusable intellectual property (IP), thereby accelerating delivery and improving margins. Second, implementing a rigorous, data-driven lead qualification and scoring process to increase proposal win rates and optimize sales and marketing spend. Third, establishing a disciplined governance cadence that uses real-time data from integrated systems to drive decision-making, ensuring the firm's operational rhythm supports its strategic ambitions.



## 0. The 'Why': Rationale for an Investor-Grade Operational Framework



An operational framework is far more than an internal procedural manual; it is a strategic asset that directly underpins enterprise value. For a professional services firm seeking to scale and attract investment, this framework serves as the narrative that substantiates its financial projections. It provides tangible evidence of how the organization will translate its vision into consistent, profitable execution.15



### Connecting the Framework to Predictable Profitability



The foundation of predictable profitability is the transition from reliance on individual "heroic" efforts to a system of repeatable, standardized processes.1 A well-defined operational framework drives this transition by standardizing workflows, defining roles, and establishing clear performance metrics.17 This standardization is the primary mechanism for controlling delivery costs, managing scope, and ensuring consistent project margins, which are the core components of profitability in a services business.19 Research from Service Performance Insight (SPI) provides a clear, quantitative link between operational maturity and financial success. Firms operating at the highest levels of maturity—characterized by institutionalized and optimized processes—consistently outperform their less mature peers, achieving significantly higher profit margins and revenue growth.1 This demonstrates that a systematic approach to operations is not an administrative burden but a direct driver of financial performance.



### Establishing the Link to PE Readiness and Due Diligence Success



Private equity due diligence is a forensic examination designed to identify risks and validate a target company's potential for scalable growth.21 A documented, benchmark-validated operational framework serves as a preemptive due diligence package, directly addressing the key questions posed by investors across multiple workstreams.

- **Operational Due Diligence:** The framework provides clear evidence of scalable processes, mitigating the critical "key-person risk" that is a major concern for investors in service-based businesses.23 It proves the business's ability to grow is not tied to a few indispensable individuals but is embedded in its systems.
- **Financial Due Diligence:** By standardizing processes like project delivery and billing, the framework supports consistent revenue recognition and margin calculation, which are essential for a successful Quality of Earnings (QoE) analysis.21
- **Commercial and Technical Due Diligence:** The framework outlines how the firm wins and retains clients, manages its talent pool, and leverages technology (e.g., Professional Services Automation (PSA), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems) to enable its processes and ensure data integrity.24

An investor is fundamentally assessing the quality and predictability of future cash flows. The existence of a robust operational framework provides a high degree of confidence that the historical performance is repeatable and that the future growth story is credible and achievable.21



### Architecting for Scalable and Repeatable Operations



Scalability in professional services is achieved by scaling intellectual capital, reputation, and relationships—not merely by adding headcount.26 The operational framework is the architecture for this type of non-linear growth. It provides the "playbooks" and standardized processes that enable consistent, high-quality execution regardless of which consultant or project manager is assigned to a task.17 This decouples revenue growth from a direct dependency on hiring, allowing the firm to increase its revenue per employee and improve overall efficiency.

Furthermore, the true strategic value of the framework to an investor is the reliable data it generates. A mature operational model, supported by integrated systems, produces a consistent stream of data on core metrics like utilization, project margins, and sales cycle length. This historical data is the foundation for credible financial forecasting. Without it, projections are speculative. With it, an investor can model future performance with confidence, which reduces their perception of risk and can directly increase the valuation they are willing to offer. This data-driven approach is essential for crafting the "compelling growth story" that is a prerequisite for a successful transaction.21 Finally, a well-documented framework serves as a critical tool for post-investment value creation, particularly for a PE-backed roll-up strategy. It provides a proven playbook for rapidly integrating bolt-on acquisitions, aligning their operations, and accelerating the realization of cost and revenue synergies.



## 1. Core Process 1: Strategy-to-Plan



The Strategy-to-Plan process is the mechanism that translates the firm's high-level vision into the specific, measurable, and time-bound objectives that guide operational execution. For an investor, a disciplined approach here is a powerful signal that growth is managed and intentional, not accidental. It provides a clear answer to the critical diligence question: "Does this management team have a credible and data-driven plan to achieve its financial forecast?".16



### 1.1. Annual Planning



- **Draft Point:** The firm will conduct an annual planning process to set financial targets and strategic initiatives for the upcoming year.
- **Validation:** This is a foundational best practice. Effective strategic planning begins with defining the "north star"—the desired future state of the business over a 3-5 year horizon, including both quantitative and qualitative goals.28 This long-term vision must then be grounded in the realities of the core business, its market opportunities, and its current capabilities to ensure the plan is both aspirational and achievable.28
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The practice of annual planning is universally accepted. The key to its effectiveness, and its credibility with investors, lies in the rigor of the process.



### 1.2. Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs)



- **Draft Point:** The leadership team will hold QBRs to review performance against the annual plan.
- **Validation:** A quarterly review cadence is a validated best practice for maintaining operational control and agility. Frameworks like the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS) emphasize setting quarterly goals and priorities to create focus and track progress toward the annual vision.16 This rhythm allows leadership to review performance data, identify deviations from the plan, and make timely adjustments, demonstrating a proactive management style.29
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** QBRs are essential for translating the annual strategy into tactical execution and for demonstrating a culture of accountability.



### 1.3. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics for this process include Forecast Accuracy and Plan vs. Actual Bookings.

- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**

  - **Forecast Accuracy:** While specific external benchmarks for forecast accuracy are not widely published, the practice of tracking it as a KPI is a hallmark of a mature organization. The goal is continuous improvement, achieved by building a forecast archive and systematically comparing forecasts to actual results over time.30 Mature PSOs leverage integrated PSA and ERP systems, which connect pipeline, backlog, and resource data, to improve the accuracy of revenue forecasts.31An internal target of achieving a quarterly revenue forecast within a range of +/- 10-15% is a common, albeit aggressive, goal. 

    **(Uncited / Assumption)**.

  - **Plan vs. Actual Bookings:** This is a fundamental KPI for any services firm. It measures the sales team's success in securing the new business required to meet revenue targets. According to the 2024 SPI Professional Services Maturity Benchmark, the forecast for quarterly bookings reached 166% of target, indicating that while client demand is strong, converting that demand into closed deals remains a challenge.2 This highlights the importance of not just tracking bookings against a plan, but also assessing the quality and velocity of the sales pipeline that feeds those bookings.

- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These are the correct KPIs for this process. The focus should be on improving accuracy over time through better data and integrated systems.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework correctly identifies the essential activities of the Strategy-to-Plan process. The primary gap is the potential for this process to be conducted in a silo, disconnected from the operational realities of the sales and delivery functions. The greatest risk is creating a financial plan that is detached from the firm's actual capacity to sell and deliver work, rendering the forecast unreliable.

A critical disconnect between the strategic plan and the firm's resource management capabilities is a primary driver of margin erosion. This occurs when the annual plan sets aggressive revenue targets, incentivizing the sales team to close deals without full visibility into the delivery team's capacity or skillset. If the resource planning function is not integrated into this process and lacks insight into the *type* and *timing* of deals in the pipeline, it cannot hire, train, or schedule proactively. This leads to a reactive staffing scramble, often forcing the use of expensive last-minute contractors or assigning sub-optimally skilled consultants to projects. Both outcomes directly compress project margins and undermine the profitability targets set in the annual plan.33

**Refinements:**

1. **Integrate Operational Data into Planning:** The annual plan and quarterly forecasts should not be purely financial exercises. They must be direct outputs of an integrated model that includes the weighted sales pipeline from the CRM and the resource capacity forecast from the PSA system.31
2. **Adopt Scenario Modeling:** Rather than creating a single-point forecast, leverage scenario planning to model potential outcomes based on different assumptions about win rates, project timelines, and resource availability. This practice, recommended by Oracle, provides a more realistic range of potential performance and better prepares the firm for variability.35
3. **Define What You Are \*Not\* Doing:** A key output of the strategic planning process should be a clear declaration of initiatives and markets that are being deprioritized. This creates focus and prevents the organization from diluting its resources on non-strategic activities.28



## 2. Core Process 2: Market-to-Lead



This process represents the top of the sales funnel and is the engine for generating new business opportunities. An efficient, measurable, and scalable Market-to-Lead process is critical for demonstrating to an investor that the firm's growth is not solely dependent on the founders' personal networks or ad-hoc efforts. It directly influences Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), a metric heavily scrutinized during due diligence.



### 2.1. Demand Generation



- **Draft Point:** The firm will execute multi-channel demand generation campaigns.
- **Validation:** This is a standard practice. A modern marketing strategy for PSOs involves a mix of digital and traditional techniques, including creating SEO-optimized content (blogs, white papers), participating in online channels, and engaging in offline activities like speaking engagements and networking.36 The goal is to create a steady stream of inbound interest.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The key is to measure the effectiveness of each channel independently.



### 2.2. Lead Nurturing



- **Draft Point:** Leads will be nurtured through targeted communication until they are sales-ready.
- **Validation:** Lead nurturing is a critical best practice, as research shows that the majority of newly acquired leads are not immediately ready to buy.37 A structured nurturing process, often using marketing automation, keeps the firm top-of-mind and educates the prospect over time. The average frequency between nurture communications is around 11 days, balancing engagement with the risk of "brand fatigue".37
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This process is essential for maximizing the value of marketing investments.



### 2.3. MQL/SQL Handoff



- **Draft Point:** Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) will be passed to the sales team for qualification into Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs).
- **Validation:** The MQL-to-SQL handoff is a pivotal and often problematic step. A major cause of friction between sales and marketing is the perception that marketing sends unqualified leads. A MarketingSherpa survey found that 61% of marketers send all leads to sales, even though only 27% are actually qualified.37 Success requires tight alignment between the two teams on the specific, objective criteria that define an MQL and an SQL.37
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The definition and governance of this handoff are more important than the activity itself.



### 2.4. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include MQL to SQL Conversion Rate, CAC Payback Period, and Marketing Spend as a % of Revenue.
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **MQL to SQL Conversion Rate:** Benchmarks vary significantly by industry and lead source. A broad cross-industry average is around 13%.39 However, for B2B firms, performance is often higher, with leads from websites converting at an average of 31% and referrals at 24%.39 In specific tech sectors like IT/Cybersecurity, rates of 15-18% are common, while top-performing B2B SaaS companies can achieve rates as high as 40% through advanced lead scoring and alignment.40
  - **CAC Payback Period:** This is a critical metric for investors assessing capital efficiency. For SaaS companies, which serve as a strong proxy for tech-enabled services, a payback period of less than 12 months is considered healthy and indicative of a strong business model.10 The median payback period reported in 2024 was 14-18 months, suggesting that a 12-month target is aggressive but achievable for top performers.10
  - **Marketing Spend as % of Revenue:** This metric is highly dependent on the firm's growth stage and industry. A common rule of thumb is to invest 5-10% of revenue to sustain current market position and 11-20% to actively grow market share.41 Industry-specific benchmarks show wide variance; a 2024 Deloitte CMO survey reported that technology companies allocated an average of 31% of revenue to marketing, while the cross-industry average from APQC is closer to 7.4%.41
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These are essential, investor-grade metrics that directly measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the firm's growth engine.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework correctly outlines the process flow but may lack the necessary rigor in lead qualification and inter-team alignment. The primary risk of an unoptimized Market-to-Lead process is "channel blindness," where the firm over-invests in low-quality lead sources, inflating CAC and wasting valuable sales resources on unproductive conversations.

This inefficiency stems from a failure to track conversion rates and cost-per-lead at a granular, channel-specific level. Different marketing channels (e.g., organic search, paid advertising, webinars) produce leads of varying quality, intent, and cost.43 Without a system to measure the downstream success of leads from each channel, marketing budget allocation is often driven by lead volume rather than lead value. This inevitably leads to a high volume of low-quality MQLs that the sales team rightfully rejects, creating a cycle of mistrust and inefficiency that an investor will quickly identify by comparing marketing expenditures to new business growth.37

**Refinements:**

1. **Implement a Formal Lead Scoring Model:** Develop and automate a lead scoring system that assigns points based on both demographic/firmographic fit (e.g., company size, industry) and behavioral engagement (e.g., website visits, content downloads, pricing page views).43 This ensures that only leads meeting a minimum score threshold are classified as MQLs.
2. **Establish a Sales-Marketing Service Level Agreement (SLA):** Create a formal, documented SLA that defines the precise criteria for an MQL and an SQL, the process for lead handoff, and, critically, the required lead response time from the sales team.40 This creates mutual accountability.
3. **Track KPIs by Channel:** Move beyond aggregate metrics. The marketing and sales dashboards must track MQLs, SQLs, conversion rates, and ultimately, cost-per-opportunity for each individual marketing channel. This data is essential for optimizing marketing spend and focusing resources on the channels that deliver the highest quality leads.38



## 3. Core Process 3: Partner-to-Pipeline



A mature and productive partner channel is a powerful indicator of a firm's ability to achieve scalable, capital-efficient growth. It diversifies lead sources, can significantly lower customer acquisition costs, and provides third-party validation of the firm's value proposition. For investors, a well-managed partner ecosystem is a force multiplier for growth.



### 3.1. Partner Program Management



- **Draft Point:** The firm will manage a partner program to generate leads and opportunities.
- **Validation:** Establishing a formal partner program is a validated best practice for scaling a services business. Effective programs are built on clear expectations, mutual goals, and strong support systems.44This includes providing partners with dedicated sales, marketing, and technical support to show that the firm is invested in their success.44
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The success of the program depends on treating partners as a strategic extension of the internal team, not just a transactional lead source.



### 3.2. Partner Onboarding and Enablement



- **Draft Point:** New partners will be onboarded and enabled to effectively represent the firm.
- **Validation:** A structured onboarding process is critical for accelerating a new partner's time to productivity.45 This should include training on the firm's service offerings, ideal customer profile, and rules of engagement. Enablement involves providing partners with the necessary resources, such as marketing materials, sales collateral, and technical documentation, often through a centralized partner portal.46
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** Consistent onboarding and enablement are key to ensuring partners can represent the brand and value proposition accurately.



### 3.3. Deal Registration



- **Draft Point:** Partners will register potential deals to ensure visibility and avoid channel conflict.
- **Validation:** A seamless and fair deal registration process is the cornerstone of a successful partner program.46 It provides the firm with crucial pipeline visibility and protects the partner's investment in developing an opportunity. This process is critical for building trust and ensuring that the firm's direct sales team does not compete with its partners on deals they have sourced.46
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This is arguably the single most important operational element for maintaining a healthy partner ecosystem.



### 3.4. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include % of Pipeline Sourced or Influenced by partners.
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **% Pipeline Sourced/Influenced:** This is the primary KPI for measuring a partner program's contribution. Benchmarks indicate that high-performing programs can be incredibly impactful. Partner-sourced revenue often exceeds 25% of a company's total revenue, with partner-influenced revenue representing 40% or more of the total pipeline.48 More conservative industry averages suggest a range of 5-15%, with performance above 25% considered excellent.49
  - **Partner Deal Performance vs. Direct Deals:** It is crucial to track the relative performance of partner-involved deals. Data shows that partner-sourced deals often exhibit superior metrics: they can have a 40% higher average order value, close 46% faster, and achieve a 53% higher win rate compared to non-partner deals.48 Tracking these metrics provides powerful evidence of the program's ROI.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The data strongly supports the strategic value of a partner channel, not just for pipeline volume but for pipeline quality and efficiency.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework acknowledges the importance of a partner channel but may treat partners as a single, monolithic group. The most significant risk in a partner program is the creation of channel conflict, which erodes trust and demotivates partners from bringing new opportunities. This conflict almost always arises from a poorly defined or non-existent deal registration process.

When a partner invests their time, resources, and reputation to cultivate a lead, they expect that investment to be protected. If the firm's direct sales team simultaneously pursues the same opportunity without a clear, transparent, and consistently enforced system for establishing priority (typically based on first registration), the partner will perceive the firm as a competitor rather than a partner. This perception, even if based on a single incident, can quickly spread through the partner community and cause them to disengage, effectively neutralizing the entire channel as a growth lever.46 An experienced investor will specifically probe for the existence and rigor of the deal registration process during due diligence.

**Refinements:**

1. **Segment the Partner Program:** Differentiate partners by type and contribution, such as Referral Partners (who provide leads), Resellers or Value-Added Resellers (VARs) (who sell on the firm's behalf), and System Integrators (SIs) (who implement solutions).44 Create tailored program tiers, expectations, and incentive structures for each segment.
2. **Implement a Partner Relationship Management (PRM) System:** Deploy a dedicated PRM platform or leverage a robust partner portal within the existing CRM (e.g., Salesforce Partner Relationship Management).50 This system should be the single source of truth for deal registration, lead distribution, resource access (marketing development funds, collateral), and performance tracking.46
3. **Establish Clear Rules of Engagement:** Formally document and communicate the rules that govern interactions between the direct sales team and partners. This document should unambiguously define the deal registration process, protocols for resolving potential conflicts, and guidelines for co-selling activities.



## 4. Core Process 4: Lead-to-Opportunity



The Lead-to-Opportunity process is where initial interest is qualified and converted into a tangible sales pursuit. The efficiency of this process directly impacts sales cycle length, sales team productivity, and the quality of the overall pipeline. For an investor, this stage demonstrates the firm's ability to effectively filter demand and focus its expensive sales resources on deals it has a high probability of winning.



### 4.1. Lead Qualification and Routing



- **Draft Point:** Inbound leads are qualified against defined criteria and routed to the appropriate sales representative.
- **Validation:** This is a critical first step. Best practice dictates that qualification should be based on a pre-defined lead scoring model that assesses a prospect's fit and intent.51 Rapid response is paramount; research consistently shows that responding to a lead within the first five minutes dramatically increases the probability of qualification and conversion—by as much as 21 times compared to a 30-minute response.43 Automated lead routing tools are essential for achieving this speed but are not a panacea if the underlying process is flawed.54
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The speed and accuracy of this initial qualification and routing step set the tone for the entire sales cycle.



### 4.2. Discovery and Needs Analysis



- **Draft Point:** Sales representatives conduct discovery calls to understand the prospect's needs and challenges.
- **Validation:** A thorough discovery and needs analysis is fundamental to consultative selling. The goal is to move beyond a surface-level understanding and identify the prospect's core business problem, the quantifiable impact of that problem, and the urgency to solve it.55 This step aligns the firm's potential solution directly with the client's pain points, forming the basis for a value-based proposal rather than a price-based one.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This is where a generic lead is transformed into a qualified opportunity.



### 4.3. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include Lead Response Time and Lead-to-Opportunity Conversion Rate.
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **Lead Response Time:** This is a crucial metric with clear benchmarks. The ideal target is under 5 minutes.53 However, studies show this is rarely achieved. One study found the average email response time was nearly 12 hours, and the average phone response was over 14 hours.54 Industry benchmarks vary, with telecommunications being the fastest (average 16 minutes) and healthcare being the slowest (average 2 hours, 5 minutes).53
  - **Lead-to-Opportunity Conversion Rate:** This metric measures the percentage of raw leads that are successfully qualified into sales opportunities. A good benchmark for B2B companies is generally considered to be in the 10-15% range.51 This rate is a key indicator of the quality of leads being generated by marketing and the effectiveness of the sales team's initial qualification efforts.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These KPIs measure the two most important dimensions of this process: speed and effectiveness.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework outlines the correct sequence of activities. The most common gap in this process is the lack of a standardized, consistently applied qualification methodology across the sales team. This leads to a "happy ears" problem, where sales reps, eager to build their pipeline, advance under-qualified leads into the opportunity stage. The risk is a bloated, low-quality pipeline that consumes significant sales and pre-sales resources on deals that have a low probability of closing, ultimately depressing the firm's overall win rate and increasing the cost of sales.

This lack of rigor in the Lead-to-Opportunity stage creates a domino effect of inefficiency throughout the sales cycle. An unqualified opportunity entering the pipeline requires the same, if not more, effort as a qualified one: discovery calls, solutioning sessions, demonstrations, and proposal writing. When these efforts are expended on a prospect who lacks a clear need, budget, or authority, the resources are wasted. This not only inflates the cost per acquisition but also diverts the attention of the firm's best solution architects and proposal writers away from deals that are genuinely winnable. An investor analyzing the sales funnel will quickly identify this issue by noting a low conversion rate from the opportunity stage to the closed-won stage, a clear sign of poor initial qualification.

**Refinements:**

1. **Implement a Standardized Qualification Framework:** Adopt a formal qualification methodology like BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) or a more modern equivalent like MEDDPICC (Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion, Competition).56 Mandate that every lead must have these fields completed in the CRM before it can be converted to an opportunity.
2. **Establish a Formal Opportunity Review Cadence:** Implement a weekly or bi-weekly opportunity review meeting where sales reps present their newly created opportunities to sales leadership. This meeting should serve as a forum to challenge assumptions and ensure that only genuinely qualified deals advance in the pipeline.
3. **Automate and Enforce SLAs for Lead Response:** Use CRM automation to immediately route new, high-intent leads (e.g., "Contact Us" or "Demo Request" forms) to the appropriate sales rep and trigger alerts. Track response times against the SLA (e.g., 5-15 minutes for hot leads) and report on adherence in sales team meetings to enforce accountability.53



## 5. Core Process 5: Opportunity-to-Proposal



The Opportunity-to-Proposal process is where a qualified need is translated into a formal, compelling solution and commercial offer. A disciplined process here is crucial for managing pre-sales resource costs, ensuring the proposed solution is both technically sound and profitable, and maximizing the probability of winning the deal. For an investor, this process demonstrates the firm's ability to scope complex work accurately and protect its margins from the outset.



### 5.1. Solutioning and Scoping



- **Draft Point:** A solution is designed to meet the client's needs, and the scope of work is defined.

- **Validation:** This is a critical, collaborative step. The sales professional must work with delivery experts (e.g., solution architects, practice leads) to craft a solution that is not only compelling to the client but also deliverable within the firm's capabilities and profitability targets.55 A best practice is to develop a preliminary solution or "discussion document" and review it with the client for feedback 

  *before* investing heavily in a full proposal. This ensures alignment and avoids surprises.57

- **Commentary:** **Validated.** Failure to align the proposed solution with delivery reality is a primary source of project failure and margin erosion.



### 5.2. Go/No-Go Decision



- **Draft Point:** A formal decision is made on whether to commit resources to developing a full proposal.
- **Validation:** A formal Go/No-Go decision gate is a hallmark of a mature professional services organization. Pursuing every opportunity is a recipe for wasting resources and lowering win rates. The decision should be based on a structured evaluation of the opportunity against key criteria, such as strategic fit, ability to win, competitive landscape, and potential profitability.56 High-performing teams are more rigorous in qualifying opportunities and saying "no" to those with a low probability of success.8
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This discipline is essential for focusing expensive pre-sales resources on the most winnable deals.



### 5.3. Proposal Development



- **Draft Point:** The proposal document is created, reviewed, and approved.
- **Validation:** This is the execution phase of the process. Effective proposal development relies on leveraging pre-approved content, templates, and reusable assets to ensure consistency and speed.9 The process should include clear roles for contributors (e.g., writers, subject matter experts, reviewers) and a defined workflow for drafting, reviewing, and approving the final document.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The efficiency of this step is heavily influenced by the quality of the firm's knowledge management practices.



### 5.4. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include Proposal Win Rate and Proposal Cycle Time.
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **Proposal Win Rate (New Business):** This is a critical measure of sales and solutioning effectiveness. The average RFP win rate across industries is approximately 45%.8 Some sources suggest aiming for a target of 50-60% to be considered competitive.9 Win rates vary by deal size, with firms often winning 35-45% of small deals (e.g., <$50k) but only 15-25% of large deals (e.g., >$100k).59 Only a very small fraction of firms (2%) report win rates above 80%.60 For existing business, win rates are significantly higher, with a median of around 62%.7
  - **Proposal Cycle Time:** This measures the time from receiving a request (e.g., an RFP) to submitting the proposal. Shorter turnaround times demonstrate agility. Benchmarks suggest top performers submit high-quality proposals in 10 business days or less, while targets can be tiered by complexity: e.g., 10 days for small, 15 for medium, and 20-25 for large proposals.9
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These KPIs directly measure the efficiency and effectiveness of the firm's entire pre-sales motion.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework correctly identifies the key steps. The most significant gap is often the lack of a formal, data-driven Go/No-Go process. The risk of not having this discipline is "proposal sprawl," where the organization's most valuable subject matter experts are constantly pulled into writing proposals for low-probability opportunities. This not only leads to a low overall win rate but also creates internal burnout and takes senior resources away from billable client work, creating a double impact on profitability.

This lack of strategic focus in the proposal phase is a clear indicator of an immature sales process to an investor. It suggests that the firm is reactive rather than proactive, chasing any deal that comes in the door instead of strategically targeting opportunities where it has a distinct competitive advantage. This leads to a vicious cycle: a low win rate forces the team to bid on even more opportunities to meet its targets, which further spreads resources thin and keeps the win rate low. This inefficiency is expensive and signals a lack of strategic control over the sales process.

**Refinements:**

1. **Formalize the Go/No-Go Process:** Create a standardized Go/No-Go checklist or scorecard that must be completed for every significant opportunity. The scorecard should objectively rate the opportunity on factors like relationship strength, solution fit, competitive positioning, and alignment with the firm's strategic goals. Set a minimum score required to proceed with a full proposal effort.
2. **Establish a Proposal Content Library:** Invest in a centralized knowledge management system or proposal automation software to store and manage reusable proposal content, such as case studies, team bios, security information, and standard methodology descriptions.58 This dramatically reduces the time spent "locating, organizing and updating content," which is a top challenge for PSOs.58
3. **Track Proposal Effort Cost:** Implement a system (e.g., using non-billable project codes in the time-tracking system) to track the hours spent by all team members on each proposal effort. Analyzing the cost of pursuit against the win rate and deal value provides a clear ROI on sales efforts and helps reinforce the importance of the Go/No-Go discipline.



## 6. Core Process 6: Proposal-to-Close



The Proposal-to-Close process is the final stage of the sales cycle, where a formal offer is converted into a signed contract. This phase tests the firm's negotiation skills, contracting efficiency, and ability to set the stage for a successful project kickoff. For an investor, a smooth and predictable process here indicates strong commercial discipline and a reduced risk of deals falling through at the last minute.



### 6.1. Contract Negotiation



- **Draft Point:** The firm negotiates the final terms of the contract and Statement of Work (SOW) with the client.
- **Validation:** This is a standard and critical step. The negotiation should not only cover price but also clarify scope, deliverables, timelines, acceptance criteria, and payment terms to minimize ambiguity during the project.61 The goal is to arrive at a mutually agreeable contract that protects both parties.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** A strong negotiation process sets clear expectations and is the first step in effective project management.



### 6.2. Contract Execution



- **Draft Point:** The final contract is executed by both parties.
- **Validation:** This involves the formal signing of the agreement, which legally binds the client and the firm. Following execution, the project can be formally initiated.57
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This is the official trigger for transitioning from the sales process to the delivery process.



### 6.3. Project Setup



- **Draft Point:** The project is set up in the firm's systems, and a kickoff meeting is scheduled.
- **Validation:** Once a contract is signed, administrative setup is required. This includes creating the project in the PSA/ERP system, finalizing the budget, assigning the core team, and scheduling the internal and external kickoff meetings.62 The purpose of the kickoff meeting is to ensure all stakeholders share a common understanding of the project's scope, schedule, and objectives before work begins.63
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** A disciplined project setup process ensures a smooth handoff from sales to delivery.



### 6.4. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include Time to Kickoff After Contract Signature and Average Sales Cycle Length.

- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**

  - **Time to Kickoff After Contract Signature:** There are no widely published, formal benchmarks for this metric. It is highly dependent on client availability and project complexity. However, anecdotal evidence and best practices suggest that this period should be minimized to maintain momentum. A target of one to two weeks is a reasonable internal goal.64 Delays here can signal a lack of urgency or internal process inefficiencies. 

    **(Uncited / Assumption)**.

  - **Average Sales Cycle Length:** This metric measures the total time from initial lead qualification to a signed contract. It is a key indicator of sales efficiency. While benchmarks vary significantly by industry and deal complexity, tracking this metric internally and working to reduce it is a primary goal. For B2B sales, cycles can range from a few weeks for simple transactions to many months for complex enterprise deals.66 The key is to segment this KPI by deal size and service type to identify bottlenecks.

- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These KPIs measure the velocity and efficiency of the final stages of the sales process and the transition to delivery.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework covers the necessary steps. A common gap is the lack of standardized contract templates and a formal handoff process from the sales team to the delivery team. The primary risk is "sales-delivery disconnect," where the delivery team is handed a project with unclear scope, unrealistic timelines, or insufficient budget because they were not properly involved in the final stages of the sales cycle. This leads to immediate project challenges, client dissatisfaction, and likely margin erosion as the delivery team scrambles to meet commitments made by sales.

This disconnect is a classic organizational flaw that investors look for. It signals poor internal communication and a lack of cross-functional process discipline. When the sales team is incentivized solely on closing deals, they may be tempted to agree to unfavorable terms or scope concessions to get a contract signed, effectively "throwing the project over the wall" to delivery. The resulting project overruns, change orders, and client escalations destroy profitability and damage the firm's reputation. This demonstrates a lack of control over the end-to-end revenue lifecycle.

**Refinements:**

1. **Standardize Contract Templates:** Work with legal counsel to develop pre-approved templates for Master Services Agreements (MSAs) and Statements of Work (SOWs). This speeds up the contracting process, reduces legal review cycles, and ensures that key commercial protections are included in every agreement.
2. **Implement a Formal Sales-to-Services Handoff Process:** Create a mandatory handoff meeting for every new project. This meeting should include the lead salesperson, the assigned Project/Engagement Manager, and key solution architects. The sales team must formally walk the delivery team through the SOW, client expectations, key stakeholders, and any unique commitments made during the sales cycle. This process should be documented with a formal handoff checklist in the CRM/PSA system.67
3. **Involve Delivery in Final Negotiations:** For large or complex engagements, make it standard practice to include the designated Engagement Manager or Practice Lead in the final SOW negotiation and review process. This ensures that delivery timelines, scope, and resource assumptions are validated by the team that will be responsible for execution before the contract is signed.



## 7. Core Process 7: Demand-to-Resource



This process is the operational heart of a professional services organization, governing how client demand (sold projects) is matched with the firm's primary asset: its people. Excellence in this process is a direct driver of the two most critical levers of profitability—billable utilization and project margin. For an investor, the maturity of the Demand-to-Resource process is a primary indicator of the firm's ability to convert sales into profitable revenue efficiently and at scale.



### 7.1. Resource Forecasting and Capacity Planning



- **Draft Point:** The firm forecasts resource needs based on the sales pipeline and plans capacity accordingly.
- **Validation:** This is a critical best practice that separates high-maturity PSOs from their peers. Effective resource management requires visibility not just into active projects but also into the upstream demand from the sales pipeline.34 By analyzing the weighted pipeline, resource managers can forecast future demand for specific skills and roles, allowing them to make proactive decisions about hiring, training, and contractor usage.34
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** A reactive, project-by-project staffing approach is inefficient and a significant barrier to scaling.



### 7.2. Resource Allocation and Scheduling



- **Draft Point:** Resources are allocated to projects based on skills and availability.
- **Validation:** This is the core execution step. Best practices involve maintaining a centralized, up-to-date inventory of employee skills, experience, and availability.34 The allocation process should align resources with project priority, assigning the most skilled and experienced team members to the most critical engagements to maximize the probability of success.69
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The effectiveness of allocation depends entirely on the quality and accessibility of data about both resource supply (skills, availability) and project demand.



### 7.3. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include Billable Utilization Rate, Bench %, and Forecast vs. Actual Hours.
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **Billable Utilization Rate:** This is one of the most heavily scrutinized KPIs in the industry. The long-standing industry benchmark for an optimal rate is 75%, balancing profitability with time for non-billable activities like training and business development.3 However, recent SPI Research data shows the industry average has fallen to 68.9%.2 Benchmarks vary significantly by role and business model. For "Procedure" based consulting firms, a target of 80-85% is common.4 For individual roles, junior consultants may be expected to reach 80-90%, while senior partners with management and sales responsibilities may have targets between 30-70%.70 A healthy blended target for a delivery team is typically in the 70-85% range.5
  - **Bench % (Non-billable time):** This is the inverse of the utilization rate. While specific external benchmarks for "bench time" are not readily available, it is a critical internal metric to minimize. A high bench percentage indicates excess capacity, inaccurate forecasting, a sales shortfall, or a mismatch between available skills and market demand. The goal is to keep unplanned, non-productive bench time as low as possible. **(Uncited / Assumption)**.
  - **Forecast vs. Actual Hours:** This KPI measures the accuracy of project estimation and resource planning. While no specific benchmarks exist, tracking this variance is essential for a continuous improvement feedback loop. Consistently underestimating hours leads to project overruns and margin erosion, while overestimating can lead to under-utilization.30
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** Utilization is the cornerstone metric, but it must be analyzed in context with project profitability and employee satisfaction to avoid driving the wrong behaviors (e.g., maximizing hours on low-margin work).



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework correctly identifies the core activities. The most significant potential gap is a failure to connect resource planning with sales pipeline data, leading to a purely reactive staffing model. The primary risk is a chronic "skills mismatch," where the firm has a bench of consultants with legacy skills while simultaneously struggling to staff projects that require new, in-demand expertise. This is a major red flag for investors, as it signals a fundamental inability of the business model to adapt to market changes.

A skills mismatch creates a severe, two-pronged attack on profitability. First, the firm incurs the cost of paying salaried employees who are sitting on the bench because their skills are no longer in demand, leading to low utilization. Second, to deliver the projects it has sold, the firm is forced to hire expensive contractors or third-party providers at a premium, which directly compresses project margins. This situation, where the firm is simultaneously paying for idle resources and overpaying for active ones, is financially unsustainable and demonstrates a critical failure in strategic workforce planning. SPI Research explicitly identifies skills mismatches as a significant cause of poor service execution and project overruns.33

**Refinements:**

1. **Integrate CRM and PSA Systems:** The highest-priority refinement is to ensure seamless data flow between the CRM (which holds pipeline and demand data) and the PSA or resource management system (which holds resource capacity, skills, and availability data). This integration is the technical foundation for proactive capacity planning.34
2. **Develop a Dynamic Skills Matrix:** Move beyond static job titles. Create and maintain a detailed, searchable skills matrix or inventory that captures each employee's specific technical skills, certifications, industry experience, and proficiency levels. This allows for more precise and effective resource allocation.34
3. **Establish a Formal Resource Governance Model:** Create a regular (e.g., weekly) resource management meeting that brings together delivery leaders, sales leaders, and resource managers. This forum should review current utilization, projected demand from the pipeline, and any resource conflicts or gaps, making collaborative decisions on staffing priorities and strategic hiring.34



## 8. Core Process 8: Deliver-to-Value



The Deliver-to-Value process encompasses the entire project delivery lifecycle, from kickoff to closure. It is the core operational process where the firm's promises to its clients are fulfilled. The efficiency, quality, and profitability of this process are the ultimate determinants of the firm's success. For an investor, this process is the engine of revenue generation and the primary area where operational excellence—or the lack thereof—is most visible.



### 8.1. Project Execution and Monitoring



- **Draft Point:** Projects are executed according to the plan, with regular monitoring of scope, schedule, and budget.
- **Validation:** This is the essence of project management. Best practices involve continuous monitoring of project health against the baseline plan.61 This includes tracking task completion, milestone achievement, budget consumption, and resource utilization. Regular status updates to both internal and external stakeholders are critical for maintaining alignment and transparency.61
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The key to effective monitoring is access to real-time, accurate data from a centralized project management or PSA system.



### 8.2. Change Order Management



- **Draft Point:** Changes to project scope are managed through a formal change order process.
- **Validation:** A disciplined change order process is essential for protecting project profitability and managing client expectations. Any work requested outside the original SOW must be formally documented with its impact on scope, schedule, and cost, and then approved by the client before work begins.73 This prevents "scope creep," a primary cause of project overruns and disputes.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** This process demonstrates commercial discipline and protects the firm from performing uncompensated work.



### 8.3. Project Closeout



- **Draft Point:** Projects are formally closed out, including final deliverable acceptance and a lessons-learned session.
- **Validation:** A formal project closeout process is a critical but often overlooked step. It ensures that all deliverables have been completed and formally accepted by the client, which is the trigger for final invoicing.63 The process should also include administrative tasks like closing contracts and archiving project documentation, as well as conducting a post-mortem or lessons-learned meeting to capture insights for future projects.62
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** A clean closeout process is vital for timely revenue recognition and continuous improvement.



### 8.4. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** Key metrics include On-Time Milestone Delivery, Project Gross Margin, and Change Order Capture Ratio.

- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**

  - **On-Time Delivery / Milestone Achievement:** This is a key indicator of execution quality and client satisfaction. SPI Research's 2024 benchmark reported that on-time project delivery rates have fallen to 73.4%, down from over 80% in 2021, highlighting growing challenges in service execution across the industry.2 Consistently delivering projects on schedule is a strong predictor of repeat business.76

  - **Project Gross Margin:** This is a fundamental measure of profitability. The formula is `(Project Revenue - Project Costs) / Project Revenue`. SPI Research reports an average project margin of 35.9% in 2024.2 Benchmarks can vary significantly by service type; "Commodity" services may have margins under 10%, while more complex "Procedure" services target 20-35%.4 For IT service providers, a "good" gross margin is often cited as being between 50-70%.6

  - **Change Order Capture Ratio:** This metric measures the percentage of out-of-scope work that is successfully converted into paid change orders. While no specific quantitative benchmarks are published, the goal should be as close to 100% as possible. Failure to capture this revenue represents direct profit leakage. The process itself is a validated best practice, with markups on change orders for overhead and profit typically in the 10-15% range.73

    **(Uncited / Assumption on ratio target)**.

- **Commentary:** **Validated.** These KPIs provide a balanced view of delivery performance, covering timeliness, profitability, and commercial discipline.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework outlines a sound project management process. The most common gap is the failure to systematically track project-level financial performance in real-time. The risk is "margin blindness," where the firm only discovers that a project was unprofitable after it is complete, when it is too late to take corrective action. This lack of financial control at the project level is a major concern for investors, as it suggests that overall firm profitability is unpredictable and left to chance.

Without real-time visibility into project financials, project managers are flying blind. They may be aware of schedule delays or scope issues, but they cannot see the direct financial impact of these problems on the project's bottom line. Decisions—such as whether to add resources to accelerate a task or to approve a minor scope change without a formal change order—are made without understanding their effect on profitability. This leads to a slow, silent erosion of margins across the project portfolio. An investor will quickly uncover this weakness during financial due diligence by asking for profitability reports on a project-by-project basis. An inability to produce this data is a significant red flag.

**Refinements:**

1. **Implement a PSA or Project-Based ERP System:** Deploy a system that provides a single source of truth for all project-related data, including budgets, actual costs (from timesheets and expenses), progress, and revenue. This is the foundational requirement for real-time project financial tracking.33
2. **Empower Project Managers with Financial Accountability:** Make project profitability a primary KPI for Project and Engagement Managers. Provide them with dashboards and reports from the PSA system that show real-time budget vs. actuals, margin calculations, and earned value metrics.76 This empowers them to manage their projects like a small business.
3. **Standardize Project Health Reporting:** Create a standard, color-coded (e.g., Red-Amber-Green) project health dashboard that is reviewed weekly by delivery leadership. This dashboard should report on key metrics for every active project, including schedule status, budget status, risk level, and current projected margin. This provides leadership with early warning of troubled projects, allowing them to intervene before profitability is irrevocably damaged.



## 9. Core Process 9: Change-to-Cash



The Change-to-Cash process, also known as the order-to-cash or cash conversion cycle, covers all activities from invoicing the client to collecting and applying payment. It is a critical back-office function that has a direct and significant impact on the firm's liquidity and working capital. For an investor, an efficient Change-to-Cash process is a sign of strong financial controls and operational discipline.



### 9.1. Invoicing



- **Draft Point:** Invoices are generated and sent to clients based on contract terms (e.g., time and materials, fixed fee, milestone).
- **Validation:** Timely and accurate invoicing is the first step in the collection process. Best practices include automating invoice generation from approved timesheet and expense data within a PSA or ERP system to reduce manual errors and speed up the cycle.61 Invoices should be clear, detailed, and sent promptly according to the schedule defined in the SOW.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** Delays or errors in invoicing are the most common self-inflicted cause of poor cash flow.



### 9.2. Collections



- **Draft Point:** The firm follows a defined process for following up on and collecting outstanding accounts receivable.
- **Validation:** A proactive and systematic collections process is essential. This involves regular monitoring of aged receivables and a defined cadence for follow-up communications with clients on overdue invoices.79The process should be professional but persistent, with clear escalation paths for severely delinquent accounts.
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** A passive approach to collections is a direct threat to the firm's financial stability.



### 9.3. KPIs and Benchmarks



- **Draft Point:** The key metric for this process is Days Sales Outstanding (DSO).
- **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**
  - **Days Sales Outstanding (DSO):** This is the definitive KPI for measuring collection efficiency. It is calculated as `(Total Accounts Receivable / Total Credit Sales) x Number of Days in Period`.14 For the professional services industry, a typical DSO benchmark is between 30 and 60 days.12 A DSO of less than 45 days is generally considered good, indicating a healthy cash flow cycle.14 A high or rising DSO can be a warning sign of client satisfaction issues, overly generous payment terms, or poor collection practices.14
  - **Cost to Collect:** This metric measures the total expense of the collections process as a percentage of the amount collected. While less common for PSOs to track explicitly, benchmarks from other industries show that small companies can spend 2.5-3% of revenue on collection activities, while large enterprises with automated systems can achieve costs closer to 1%.81
  - **Aged Accounts Receivable:** This involves tracking the percentage of total receivables that are past due, typically segmented into buckets (e.g., 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 90+ days). A healthy target is to have less than 10% of A/R in the 120+ day bucket.83
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** DSO is the primary metric, but tracking the composition of aged A/R provides a more detailed diagnostic tool.



### Gap Analysis, Risks, and Refinements



The draft framework correctly identifies the necessary functions. The most common gap is the lack of automation and a reactive, rather than proactive, approach to collections. The risk of an inefficient Change-to-Cash cycle is a severe working capital crunch. A services firm's primary expense—payroll—is typically on a fixed bi-weekly or monthly schedule, while its revenue collection is variable. A high DSO means the firm is effectively providing interest-free financing to its clients, forcing it to fund its own operations through a line of credit or cash reserves. This strains liquidity and can constrain the firm's ability to invest in growth.

An investor will analyze the cash conversion cycle in detail during financial due diligence. A consistently high DSO relative to industry peers is a significant red flag. It suggests underlying issues that could include poor invoicing processes, a lack of financial controls, or even systemic client dissatisfaction leading to payment disputes. It signals a higher-risk investment because it indicates the business requires more cash to fund its day-to-day operations, reducing its capital efficiency and overall financial resilience.

**Refinements:**

1. **Automate the Invoicing Process:** Implement a PSA or accounting system that automates the creation of invoices from approved time and expense entries. This eliminates manual data entry, reduces errors, and shortens the time-to-invoice cycle.78
2. **Establish a Proactive Collections Cadence:** Define and automate a standard collections workflow. For example: an automated reminder sent 5 days before the due date, a first follow-up call at 5 days past due, and a formal escalation to the account executive or leadership at 30 days past due. This ensures consistent follow-up without relying on manual tracking.
3. **Clarify Payment Terms in Contracts:** Ensure all SOWs and contracts contain clear, unambiguous payment terms, including due dates (e.g., "Net 30 days" instead of "upon receipt"), instructions for payment, and penalties for late payments where applicable. Setting these expectations upfront is the most effective way to manage DSO.78



## 10. Foundational Pillars



Beyond the linear value-chain processes, a scalable and investor-ready professional services firm is built upon foundational pillars that govern its structure, talent, and strategic assets. These pillars provide the stability and control necessary to support growth.



### 10.1. Role Scorecards & Headcount Mix



This pillar addresses the organizational structure and the specific roles and responsibilities within it. Clear roles and a balanced team composition are essential for operational efficiency, accountability, and scalable growth. Investors scrutinize the organizational structure to ensure it can support the firm's growth plans without becoming bloated with excessive overhead.

- **Role Scorecards:**

  - **Draft Point:** The firm will use scorecards to define responsibilities and KPIs for key roles.
  - **Validation:** The use of role scorecards is a validated best practice for establishing clarity and accountability. The literature provides clear outlines of the core responsibilities for key leadership roles in a PSO, such as the Practice Lead (responsible for service delivery quality, team growth, and practice P&L) and the Sales Director (responsible for revenue growth, pipeline management, and win rates).85 A well-designed scorecard should include a mission for the role, key responsibilities, and a balanced set of KPIs that measure performance against financial, client, and operational objectives.88
  - **Commentary:** **Validated.** Scorecards are essential for performance management and aligning individual contributions with company goals.

- **Headcount Mix & Operating Expense Benchmarks:**

  - **Draft Point:** The firm will maintain a target mix of billable vs. non-billable staff and manage operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.

  - **Validation & Comparative Benchmarks:**

    - **Headcount Mix (Billable vs. Non-Billable):** Direct benchmarks for this ratio are not widely published. However, the ratio can be inferred from utilization targets and leverage models. If a firm targets an average billable utilization of 75%, it implies a structural capacity for 25% of time to be spent on non-billable activities (e.g., management, sales, training, administration), which can be distributed across the team. Highly leveraged "Commodity" service models may have a very high ratio of junior billable staff to senior managers (e.g., 8:1), whereas "Grey Hair" models have a much lower leverage ratio.4

      **(Partially Cited / Inferred)**.

    - **Operating Expenses:** Benchmarks for operating expenses provide a crucial barometer of a firm's financial efficiency. For service-based enterprises, a total operating expense ratio (including all costs except direct project costs) in the range of 60-80% of revenue is considered typical.90 Marketing spend is highly variable; while the cross-industry average is around 7.4%, technology firms may invest over 30% to fuel growth.41 A detailed breakdown is provided in the table below.

  - **Commentary:** **Validated.** Managing the cost structure and operating leverage is a primary focus for any investor.

| Metric                                              | Draft Target (Illustrative) | Benchmark - Source 1                                         | Benchmark - Source 2                                        | Commentary                                                   |

### 10.2. Governance Cadence



- **Draft Point:** The firm will establish a regular cadence of meetings to govern operations.
- **Validation:** A disciplined governance cadence is the operating system of the company, ensuring that strategy is translated into action and that performance is continuously monitored. Best practices from operational excellence frameworks and major consultancies emphasize the need for a structured rhythm of meetings, from weekly tactical check-ins to quarterly strategic reviews.17 This cadence provides the forums for data-driven decision-making, risk mitigation, and cross-functional alignment.15
- **Commentary:** **Validated.** The meeting cadence is the mechanism that brings the entire operational framework to life.



### 10.3. Investor Confidence Index



- **Draft Point:** The firm will use a proprietary index to measure its operational maturity and readiness for investment.
- **Validation:** While a proprietary index is unique, the concept of assessing and benchmarking operational maturity is strongly validated by industry-standard models, most notably the SPI Professional Services Maturity Model™.1 This model provides a proven framework for evaluating a PSO's capabilities across five core pillars: Leadership, Client Relationships, Talent, Service Execution, and Finance & Operations.1Aligning the proprietary index with these established pillars would lend it immediate credibility and make it directly relevant to the due diligence process, as investors are familiar with these concepts.21 Each component of the index, such as "Process Repeatability" or "Client Concentration," can be directly mapped to a specific diligence area or maturity level, providing a comprehensive and defensible assessment of the firm's operational health.1
- **Commentary:** **Concept Validated.** The index is a powerful tool. Its credibility will be significantly enhanced by structuring it around a recognized industry model like the SPI framework.

Refinements:

The Investor Confidence Index should be more than a static score; it should function as a dynamic roadmap for value creation. By structuring the index around the five SPI pillars and selecting 2-3 key, quantifiable KPIs to represent each pillar (e.g., for the Finance & Operations pillar, using DSO and Project Margin Variance as proxies), the firm creates a powerful management tool. Tracking this index over time allows leadership to demonstrate tangible, measurable progress in de-risking the business and improving its operational maturity. This documented history of continuous improvement provides powerful evidence to a board or a potential investor that the management team is executing effectively against its value creation plan, which can significantly enhance credibility and enterprise value during a transaction.

1. **Adopt a Maturity-Based Perspective:** Reframe the operational model around an industry-standard framework like the SPI Professional Services Maturity Model™. This provides a common language for discussing performance and a clear roadmap for improvement that is credible to external stakeholders, including investors.
2. **Integrate Systems for a Single Source of Truth:** Prioritize the technical integration of the CRM and PSA/ERP systems. This is the foundational requirement for enabling data-driven processes like proactive resource forecasting, real-time project financial tracking, and accurate revenue planning.
3. **Formalize Key Decision Gates and Handoffs:**
   - Implement a mandatory, data-driven **Go/No-Go process** for all significant sales opportunities to focus resources and improve win rates.
   - Institute a formal **Sales-to-Services Handoff** protocol to ensure alignment on scope, expectations, and budget before a project begins, mitigating the risk of margin erosion.
4. **Develop a Knowledge Management & Reusable IP Strategy:** Move beyond ad-hoc reuse of assets. Create a formal strategy and system for capturing, cataloging, and leveraging reusable intellectual property (methodologies, templates, code accelerators). This is a key lever for improving delivery efficiency, ensuring consistency, and scaling the business non-linearly.
5. **Empower Managers with Financial Accountability:** Make project-level profitability (Gross Margin) a primary KPI for all Project and Engagement Managers. Provide them with the real-time data and dashboards necessary to manage their projects as individual profit-and-loss centers, fostering a culture of commercial accountability throughout the delivery organization.

# 2024 Professional Services Maturity Benchmark: A Detailed Guide

## Introduction and Core Methodology

The **2024 Professional Services Maturity™ Benchmark** is the seventeenth annual report from Service Performance Insight (SPI), a global research and consulting firm dedicated to improving productivity and profit in professional services organizations (PSOs). This report is designed to give PSOs a reliable basis to view their performance against an established benchmark of peers, providing visibility into critical business processes and key performance metrics.

This year's analysis is based on a comprehensive survey of **575 firms** conducted in the Fall of 2023, representing nearly 400,000 consultants worldwide. The report's core methodology is built upon two foundational frameworks: the Five Service Performance Pillars™ and the Professional Services Maturity Model™, which has been adopted by over 50,000 organizations.

---

## The Five Service Performance Pillars™

The report's entire structure is based on the premise that the success of all billable PSOs rests on five fundamental pillars. These pillars provide a logical and functional way to segment and analyze performance.

### 1. Leadership
This pillar examines the ability of PS executives to offer a clear and compelling strategy that provides a unifying focus for the organization. It encompasses the core processes of setting strategy, business planning, goal setting, and management, defining the role and charter of the service organization within the company.

### 2. Client Relationships
This area concentrates on the effectiveness of generating and closing business. It includes all aspects of marketing, lead generation, quoting, selling solutions, contract management, and partnering to win deals.

### 3. Talent
This pillar focuses on the ability to attract, hire, retain, and motivate a high-quality consulting workforce, which is the core asset in every service-driven organization. It includes the processes of recruiting, on-boarding, training, compensation, performance, and career management.

### 4. Service Execution
This area details all aspects of project delivery, from planning and resource management to project management, delivery methods, tools, time and expense capture, and collaboration. It focuses on the methodologies and processes required to effectively schedule, deploy, and measure the quality of the service delivery process.

### 5. Finance & Operations
This pillar considers the ability to manage the services P&L to generate revenue and profit. It focuses on all financial information, including revenue, margin, billing, collections, and the IT operating processes and controls required to run a predictable business.

---

## The Professional Services Maturity Model™

The PS Maturity Model™ is a strategic framework that categorizes PSOs into one of five levels based on their operational effectiveness. Moving to a higher level of maturity correlates directly with significant improvements in financial and operational performance.

### Level 1: Initiated ("Heroic")
- **Approximately 30% of PSOs** are at this level
- Processes are ad-hoc and fluid, and the business environment is chaotic and opportunistic
- Success depends on the competence and heroics of individuals, not on proven processes or tools
- These firms typically operate at a loss, with an average **EBITDA of -5.0%**

### Level 2: Piloted ("Functional Excellence")
- **Approximately 25% of PSOs** operate here
- Core operating processes have started to become repeatable but remain unenforced
- Best practices may exist in discrete functional areas but are not yet documented or codified for the entire firm
- Profitability is around breakeven, with an average **EBITDA of 0.3%**

### Level 3: Deployed ("Project Excellence")
- This level includes about **25% of PSOs**
- The firm has a set of standard processes and operating principles for all major pillars, though some renegades may still exist
- Project delivery methodologies are in place and enforced across the organization
- These organizations are consistently profitable, with an average **EBITDA of 13.8%**

### Level 4: Institutionalized ("Portfolio Excellence")
- **Approximately 15% of firms** achieve this level
- Management uses precise measurements, metrics, and controls to effectively manage the PSO
- Each performance pillar is supported by a detailed set of operating principles and tools, and the focus is on balancing the entire portfolio of projects
- These firms are highly profitable, with an **EBITDA of 21.3%**

### Level 5: Optimized ("Collaborative")
- The top **5% of PSOs** reach this level
- The focus is on the continual improvement of all five pillars through a disciplined, controlled process of measurement and optimization via both incremental and innovative technological changes
- These firms achieve exceptional financial results, with an average **EBITDA of 32.3%**

## Key Findings

### The State of the Professional Services Market in 2023

The report's Foreword paints a picture of a challenging year for the PS market, a significant shift after the strong rebound seen in 2021 and 2022.

#### Overall Performance Decline
Many of the most important KPIs trended downwards, indicating a tougher operating environment:

- **Year-over-Year PS Revenue Growth** fell sharply to **7.8%** in 2023, a significant drop from 10.4% in 2022 and the lowest level in the past five years
- **Employee Billable Utilization** dropped to **69.3%**, a five-year low, suggesting a decline in overall productivity
- **Project Margin** also saw a decline to **34.4%** from a five-year average of 35.5%
- The **Deal Pipeline** relative to the quarterly bookings forecast shrank to **154%**, down from a high of 183% in 2021, indicating a more challenging sales environment

#### The Rise of AI
The major technological story of 2023 was the re-emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a true "game-changer". The report posits that PSOs are at the forefront of this transformation, as they will both adopt AI internally to improve their own operations and also sell AI-centric strategy and implementation services to their clients.

### Profile of High-Performance PSOs

The report dedicates a chapter to analyzing the top 20% of firms by maturity score, labeling them High-Performance Organizations (HPOs).

HPOs dramatically outperform their peers across every financial metric:
- **13.6% YoY revenue growth** (vs. 6.3% for the rest)

- **$253k in annual revenue per billable consultant** (vs. $193k)
- **$220k per employee** (vs. $154k)

#### Sales and Client Excellence
HPOs run more effective sales operations:
- Deal pipeline is **201% of their quarterly forecast** (vs. 142% for others)
- Higher bid-to-win ratio of **55.4%** (vs. 46.2%)
- **74.9%** of an HPO's clients are referenceable (vs. 67.2% for other firms)

#### Talent and Delivery Mastery
- Higher employee billable utilization of **75.4%** (vs. 67.7% for others)
- **85.3%** of projects delivered on time (vs. 73.1%)
- Significantly higher project margins

#### Smarter Technology Use
HPOs are more likely to invest in core business applications:
- **89.5% use a commercial PSA solution** (vs. 70.4% of other firms)
- 33% more likely to have their CRM and PSA systems integrated

### The Critical Role of Business Applications

The report emphasizes the role of an integrated technology stack in achieving operational excellence through a "Plan-to-Profit" business process.

#### Professional Services Automation (PSA)
- **74.3% commercial adoption** - the core operational solution for PSOs
- Firms using PSA have:
  - 10% higher billable utilization
  - 14% higher project margins
  - 28% higher overall profit (EBITDA)

#### Client Relationship Management (CRM)
- Adopted by **79.6% of firms**
- Essential for managing the sales funnel
- Organizations using CRM experience significantly greater revenue and headcount growth and maintain larger sales pipelines

#### Project-based ERP (PBERP)
- Integrate financials with project accounting and resource management
- Firms using PBERP are **26% more profitable** than those who do not

Practices
```

Focus Area: Project Management Office

- **Having solid PMs involved in all projects would do more than any other action we could**
  **take to provide relief to our Partners, Associate Partners, and Practice Leads**
- Provide Project Management oversight and expertise to all Elire projects to ensure that
  projects are run smoothly, efficiently, and consistently
  \- Assist with Project Mobilization
  \- Ensure Service Execution methodologies, templates, tools are being used
  \- Work with the appropriate resources to ensure the project is on track and on budget
  \- Complete the Project Scorecard
- Offerings
  - Continue to provide standard, full-time PMs which the client would pay for
  - Client paid, part-time PMs, which we have not been able to really do before, as these
    part-time PMs could cover multiple projects
  - For those projects where the client does NOT want to pay for a PM, Elire would incur
    the cost of a PM checking in 2-4 hours a month to do a health check assessment
  - Assist with management/facilitation of Internal Elire projects

Focus Area: Managed Services

- **A major revenue stream for many of our competitors plus it would add more reliable**
  **income in spaces we already**
- Serve as a mechanism for younger, greener talent to join Elire
  - Easier to train for help desk activities rather than client—facing, delivery
  - Easier to provide support as the resources aren’t as “on the spot”
- After an appropriate period of time, these resources could transition to the core Delivery
  practices, as necessary
- Leverage Near Shore/Offshore
- Ensure we have best in class ticketing system

- # Analysis.md — Standalone Narrative: How We Operate Today, Why Rollups Fail, and the introduction of the Value‑Stream Model 

  > **What this is**  
  > A **plain‑English, standalone narrative** of how we run the firm **today** (org trees and current KPIs), **why** that structure fails to give operating control, and **what** we’re introducing next: a **Value‑Stream rollup** with small, controllable “atomic units.”  
  > There are **no external references required** to read this file. All diagrams are embedded as ASCII. If our database changes tomorrow, the **narrative still stands**.

  > **How to use this**  
  >
  > - **Part I — Current State:** The trees and scoreboards we actually manage today (and their gaps).  
  > - **Part II — The Value‑Stream Rollup (Concept):** The 3+2 spine and the 20 atomic units with **verbose definitions**.  
  > - **Part III — Cadence & Proof:** Weekly/monthly rhythm and a 90‑day plan to demonstrate control.  
  > - **Appendix — Current KPI list, Org outline, and a generic implementation note** (optional).

  ---

  ## Part I — Current State (what we are actually running on)

  ### 1) The organization tree we manage by (pillars → departments/COEs → practices → people)

  We manage the business through the **org tree**. Budgets and headcount live here; responsibilities are implied here. This is the day‑to‑day view leaders use.

  ```
  Firm
  ├─ Leadership
  ├─ Client Relationships
  │  ├─ Sales
  │  ├─ Marketing
  │  └─ Proposal Management & Contracts
  ├─ Service Execution
  │  ├─ Management Advisory Services (PMO, SAS)
  │  ├─ Cloud Enterprise (Cloud HCM, Cloud ERP, Cloud Technology)
  │  ├─ Solution Center (Managed Services)
  │  ├─ On‑Premise (PeopleSoft)
  │  ├─ EPM & Analytics (Planning & Analytics; Close & Consolidations)
  │  └─ Treasury (Kyriba SaaS Treasury; PeopleSoft Treasury)
  ├─ Talent
  │  ├─ HR
  │  └─ Recruiting
  └─ Finance & Operations
     ├─ Accounting
     └─ IT
  ```

  **What truly rolls up here today**

  - **Headcount & budget** roll up cleanly **practice → COE → pillar → firm**.  
  - **Work doesn’t**: the work itself isn’t defined at a small enough level, so ownership blurs and leaders pick up other pillars’ jobs.  
  - **Evidence is scattered**: decisions and proof often live in email/slides vs the systems where they belong, which breaks auditability and AI‑readiness.

  > **Bottom line:** The org tree is **necessary** (for budget/staffing/accountability by practice) but **insufficient** to run work. It lacks the **granularity** where ownership is unambiguous and levers are controllable.

  ---

  ### 2) What we measure today (the current KPI catalog — and why it doesn’t create control)

  We track a broad KPI set by pillar. This provides familiarity but **not** operating control because many metrics are **lagging**, **survey‑based**, or **not controllable** by the people measured.

  **Leadership (survey/“SPI index” style)**  

  - Vision/mission understood; confidence in leadership; ease of getting things done; alignment of goals and measurements; confidence in future; communication effectiveness; embraces change; innovation focus; “becoming more data‑driven”.

  **Client Relationships**  

  - Pipeline vs quarterly bookings; SOW closed ($); BDR‑generated opps; RFP win rate; % of won that are Managed Services; marketing‑generated pipeline ($); inbound web leads.

  **Finance & Operations**  

  - Revenue per billable consultant; revenue per employee; revenue leakage; days to invoice; hours to produce financials; invoice rework.

  **Service Execution**  

  - Path‑to‑cloud cumulative pipeline; # clients with targeted strategic messages; sales from those messages; federal SOW sales; PSA CSAT; client satisfaction.

  **Talent**  

  - Employee satisfaction; total attrition YTD; days to recruit & hire (standard roles); % employees billable.

  **Why this doesn’t give operating control**  

  - **Controllability:** Many items above can’t be directly controlled by the team reporting them (e.g., firmwide sentiment or totals).  
  - **Measurability:** Several rely on **surveys** or **manual tallies**; definitions aren’t always audit‑ready.  
  - **Rollup logic:** There’s **no common rollup** from team‑level activity to **firm outcomes**; each pillar publishes its own scoreboard.  
  - **Ownership:** Because work isn’t defined at a small enough unit, “who actually owns the lever” is unclear; leaders often carry work from other pillars.

  ---

  ### 3) Three repeating stories (where rollups and ownership break)

  **A) “Can we discount 10%?” — Pricing routes to Delivery**  
  Because scope, risk, staffing, timeline, and feasibility live in Delivery, the 10% question lands there. Sales books the deal; **Delivery absorbs the compromises**. Evidence sits in inboxes, not CRM/PSA. Result: **long decision cycles**, sold margin appears fine, **realization suffers**.

  **B) Mid‑flight scope changes — Sales inside Delivery**  
  AEs renegotiate scope during delivery; change control is bypassed. Result: **low scope‑capture**, schedule pain, margin leakage presented later as “relationship maintenance”.

  **C) Panic hiring — Talent isn’t owned at a small enough level**  
  COE leaders do midnight workforce planning; reqs open late; interviews done by the busiest people. Result: **time‑to‑fill balloons**, **senior burnout**, uneven utilization masked by averages.

  > **Root cause across all three:** We manage **pillars and outcomes**, not the **small pieces of work** where one owner has a lever to pull and where proof lives in a system.

  ---

  ## Part II — The Value‑Stream Rollup we’re introducing (conceptual)

  We will **keep** the org tree for budgets and staffing. We will **operate** the work through a different spine: **Value Streams → Atomic Units**. This spine gives us **controllable dials** and **clean rollups**.

  ### 4) The spine at a glance (3 customer streams + 2 enablers)

  - **Customer value streams:** **WIN → DELIVER → COLLECT**  
  - **Enablers:** **TALENT** and **OPERATE**  
  - *(Optional customer motion: **EXPAND** sits alongside WIN when we focus on land‑and‑expand.)*

  **How they connect (conceptual)**  

  ```
  TALENT enables → WIN & DELIVER
  OPERATE enables → all streams
  WIN feeds → DELIVER feeds → COLLECT
  ```

  ### 5) The 20 atomic units (the leaves where one “A” owns a lever) — with verbose definitions

  > **How to read these:** Each atomic unit includes **what it is**, the **decision(s)** inside it, **where evidence belongs**, **controllable driver dials**, and a **clear ownership boundary** example. This is the altitude at which we can assign exactly one **Accountable (“A”)** owner and manage a weekly dial.

  #### WIN — Create & convert opportunities (5)

  1) **WIN‑01 Lead Qualification (MQL→SQL decision)**  
     - **What it is:** Decide quickly and consistently whether a lead is worth pursuit (ICP fit, intent, speed).  
     - **Decisions:** Pursue vs park; route to the right team; define next touch & SLA.  
     - **Evidence:** CRM (lead record, qualification fields, timestamps).  
     - **Driver dials:** *Lead Response Time; Qualification Completeness*.  
     - **Ownership boundary:** Sales owns the go/no‑go and routing; Delivery is consulted for feasibility, not accountable for intake speed.

  2) **WIN‑02 Discovery & Solutioning (understand need)**  
     - **What it is:** Clarify the business problem, constraints, and solution outline at scoping fidelity (not full design).  
     - **Decisions:** Problem framing; rough effort bands; risks/assumptions.  
     - **Evidence:** CRM notes + lightweight solution outline artifact.  
     - **Driver dials:** *Solution Outline Validated* (% of pursuits with client‑validated outline).  
     - **Ownership boundary:** Sales leads discovery; Delivery contributes specific SMEs. If Delivery writes the entire solution, we’ve shifted into misattribution.

  3) **WIN‑03 Pricing & Margin Decision (set terms)**

     - **What it is:** Assemble a compliant, reusable proposal/SOW from approved content; minimize redlines.  
     - **Decisions:** Which modules/terms; reuse vs bespoke; risks called out.  
     - **Evidence:** Document/CLM repository with versioned content.  
     - **Driver dials:** *Proposal Content Reuse (%)*.  
     - **Ownership boundary:** Proposal Management is accountable for assembly; Delivery provides specific content blocks; Sales provides client context.

  5) **WIN‑05 Contract Execution (close deal)**  
     - **What it is:** Negotiate & sign MSA/SOW with clear acceptance criteria and risks.  
     - **Decisions:** Legal positions; acceptance/exit; commercial exceptions.  
     - **Evidence:** CLM; approved redline log; signature timestamps.  
     - **Driver dials:** *Win Rate* (lagging at stream), *Cycle time* (if tracked).  
     - **Ownership boundary:** Legal/Contracts is accountable for contractual integrity; Sales/Delivery advise.

     - **Evidence:** PSA tasks/milestones; RAID log.  
     - **Driver dials:** *On‑Time Delivery (% milestones on plan)*.  
     - **Ownership boundary:** PM owns cadence; technical leads deliver within plan.

  9) **DEL‑04 Scope/Change Management (control creep)**  
     - **What it is:** Capture and monetize scope deltas with discipline.  
     - **Decisions:** What is in/out; who approves; pricing for change.

     - **Driver dials:** *Scope Capture Ratio* (billed delta / identified delta).  
     - **Ownership boundary:** PM/Delivery (A) owns the gate. Sales can influence, but cannot bypass.

  10) **DEL‑05 Project Closure (get sign‑off)**  
      - **What it is:** Formal acceptance; lessons learned; reference creation.  
      - **Decisions:** Acceptance criteria met; warranty obligations; reference ask.  
      - **Evidence:** PSA closeout checklist; CSAT; reference artifacts.  
      - **Driver dials:** *On‑Time; Realization (as outcome signals)*.  
      - **Ownership boundary:** PM accountable for closure discipline.

  ### 6) How rollups will work now (drivers → outcomes → firm)

  **Principle:** *Manage what teams can control; judge leaders by outcomes.*

  ```
  Atomic Unit (leading, controllable) ──► Stream (lagging outcomes) ──► Firm (portfolio outcomes)
  e.g., Discount Decision Cycle        ──► Win Rate / Avg Sold Margin ──► EBITDA
        Scope Capture Ratio            ──► Realization / On‑Time       ──► EBITDA
        Time to Fill                   ──► Utilization                 ──► Attrition / EBITDA
  ```

  We will keep today’s pillar metrics **as context**. We will **run the business** on a small set of **driver dials at units** and **outcome scoreboards at streams/firm**.

---

  ### 7) Today vs Proposed — pillar rollups (ASCII diagrams, fully embedded)

  **Client Relationships → WIN**  

  ```
  TODAY (pillar scoreboard)
  Pipeline • SOW $ • RFP win% • Inbound leads • Managed Services %
      │
      └─ Gap: No shared dial that a Sales Director can move *this week* to change next month’s Win Rate.
         Decisions and proof are scattered; Delivery is pulled in ad hoc.
  
  PROPOSED (value‑stream rollup)
  Lead Response Time • Qualification Completeness • Discount Decision Cycle • Proposal Reuse  (unit dials, owned in CRM/CLM)
              └────────────── rolls up to ──────────────►  WIN RATE • AVG SOLD MARGIN  (stream outcomes)
                                                                  └────────► EBITDA  (firm)
  Key shifts: one “A” per unit; guardrails for pricing; reuse content; discovery at scoping fidelity.
  ```

  **Service Execution → DELIVER**  

  ```
  TODAY
  Path‑to‑Cloud pipeline • PSA CSAT • “Project green” averages
      └─ Gap: Averages hide scope leakage and late staffing; no weekly lever to force capture or accelerate staffing.
  
  PROPOSED
  Handoff Completeness • Time to Staff • Scope Capture Ratio • On‑Time  (unit dials, owned in PSA)
              └────────────── rolls up to ──────────────►  REALIZATION • ON‑TIME • UTILIZATION  (stream outcomes)
                                                                └────────► EBITDA  (firm)
  Key shifts: formal handoff gate; resourcing SLA; scope gate with pricing; milestone discipline.
  ```

  **Talent → TALENT**  

  ```
  TODAY
  Employee satisfaction • % billable • “45‑day time‑to‑hire” (averaged)
      └─ Gap: Panic hiring; seniors covering; uneven utilization hidden by averages.
  
  PROPOSED
  Time to Fill • Onboarding Handoff • Certifications per FTE  (unit dials, owned in HCM/LMS)
              └────────────── rolls up to ──────────────►  UTILIZATION (stream) • ATTRITION (firm)
  Key shifts: skill‑specific reqs with SLA; first‑bill tracking; certification coverage model.
  ```

  **Finance & Operations → COLLECT + OPERATE**  

  ```
  TODAY
  Revenue/Employee • Days to Invoice • Hours to close
      └─ Gap: Backward‑looking; little control on delivery choices or resourcing timing.
  
  PROPOSED
  Invoice Error Rate • Plan Accuracy (90d)  (unit dials, owned in ERP/forecast)
              └────────────── rolls up to ──────────────►  DSO (stream) • EBITDA (firm)
  Key shifts: billing proof standard; forecast variance ritual; earlier signals on staffing and pricing.
  ```

  **Leadership**  

  ```
  TODAY
  SPI survey index (sentiment about leadership)
  
  PROPOSED
  Owns the outcomes scoreboard (by stream + firm)
  Enforces:  one “A” per unit • evidence in system • drivers managed weekly • targets are time‑bounded
  Key shifts: judge leaders by ends; require teams to manage causes.
  ```

---

  ### 8) What changes for each pillar (keep for context / operate / judge)

  - **Client Relationships** — *Keep (context):* pipeline, RFP win%. *Operate:* response time, qualification completeness, discount cycle, proposal reuse. *Judge:* **Win Rate, Avg Sold Margin**.  
  - **Service Execution** — *Keep:* CSAT. *Operate:* handoff completeness, time‑to‑staff, scope capture, on‑time. *Judge:* **Realization, On‑Time, Utilization**.  
  - **Talent** — *Keep:* employee satisfaction. *Operate:* time‑to‑fill, onboarding handoff, certifications per FTE. *Judge:* **Attrition (firm), Utilization (stream)**.  
  - **Finance & Ops** — *Keep:* revenue/employee. *Operate:* invoice error rate, plan accuracy (90d). *Judge:* **DSO, EBITDA**.  
  - **Leadership** — *Operate:* governance of decision rights & boundaries. *Judge:* **stream outcomes** and **firm outcomes**.

---

  ## Part III — Cadence & proof

  ### 9) Weekly / Monthly rhythm

  - **Weekly (operators):** Update observed ownership where reality differs; review **Pricing**, **Scope/Change**, **Recruiting** first; manage the **driver dials** and assign actions.  
  - **Monthly (board):** Review **stream outcomes** (Win Rate, Avg Sold Margin, Realization, On‑Time, Utilization, DSO) and **firm outcomes** (EBITDA, Attrition); adjust targets for mix/seasonality.

  ### 10) The first 90 days (what we will prove)

  - **0–30 days — Discover & instrument:** Map observed “A” for the 20 units (+ SELL/EXPAND where live). Mandate evidence capture in CRM/PSA/CLM/HCM. Load 6–12 months of outcomes.  
  - **31–60 days — Fix the few that move the many:** Targets: *Discount Cycle < 24h; Scope Capture ≥ 80%; Time to Fill ≤ 45d.* Clarify discount/scope decision rights.  
  - **61–90 days — Scale:** Pilot in **Cloud Enterprise** + **On‑Prem**; show deltas in misattribution, driver KPIs, and early outcomes; decide what to institutionalize.

  - **Concepts:** *Value Streams, Atomic Units, Expected vs Observed Ownership, Systems of Record, KPIs (leading/lagging with scope unit/stream/firm), Targets, Measurements, Org tree, Financial facts*.  
  - **Portable views:**  
    - **Rosetta** — one row per atomic unit (stream, owner, systems, driver KPIs).  
    - **Misattribution Delta** — Expected vs Observed with status (Aligned / Role Mismatch / Org Mismatch / Not Observed).  
    - **Stream Health** — current **leading** driver dials by stream.  
    - **Outcomes Scoreboard** — current **lagging** outcomes by stream/firm.  
    - **Org/Financial Rollups** — headcount and budgets by practice → COE → pillar.  
  - **Note:** Names and schemas can evolve. The narrative above **does not** depend on table names.

---

  ### D) Glossary (shared language)

  - **Value Stream:** The end‑to‑end flow of client value (WIN → DELIVER → COLLECT).  
  - **Atomic Unit:** The smallest meaningful chunk of work/decision we manage; where **one** Accountable (“A”) owns a controllable driver and evidence lives in a system of record.  
  - **Leading vs Lagging KPI:** *Leading* = controllable, managed weekly at units; *Lagging* = outcomes, judged monthly at streams/firm.  
  - **System of Record:** The application where the authoritative proof lives (CRM, PSA, ERP/Financials, HCM, CLM/Docs).  
  - **Misattribution:** Expected owner in the playbook differs from observed owner in reality; we fix the system, not the person.  
  - **Rollup:** The way unit‑level drivers aggregate to stream outcomes and then to firm outcomes (drivers → outcomes → EBITDA/Attrition).

# DatabaseDesign.md — `elire_ops_1` (Updated)

**Purpose:** A single, durable “Rosetta Stone” that ties together **work**, **ownership**, **systems**, **KPIs**, and **money** so partners can see (1) who *should* own each decision vs who *does* today, (2) the controllable drivers that move outcomes, and (3) the financial footprint by practice — all from one source of truth.

---

## 0) Executive Summary — What changed since the previous design

1) **Added a new customer-facing stream: `EXPAND`** (land-and-expand motions) with three atomic units (`EXP-01..03`). Stream ordering adjusted so `COLLECT`, `TALENT`, `OPERATE` follow after EXPAND.  
*Why:* Makes cross‑sell/upsell and advocacy first-class work with explicit owners, systems, and KPIs.  [oai_citation:2‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

2) **Linked top‑level `WIN-*` units to fine‑grained SELL stages `WINA-*`** via a `unit_hierarchy_link` table (e.g., `WIN-03 Pricing` ↔ `WINA-06 Discount Decision`).  
*Why:* Lets us zoom between the 20-unit model and the SELL detail you run day‑to‑day without duplicating metrics.  [oai_citation:3‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

3) **Introduced `org_rate_card` (practice-aware rates)** alongside global `rate_card`.  
*Why:* Rate realism varies by practice; this avoids blunt averages and keeps margin math credible by unit and practice.  [oai_citation:4‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

4) **Fixed unrealistic capacity by adding external resources** (EACPs/Subs) to PeopleSoft and Treasury and **redistributed hours**.  
*Why:* Hours/person were impossible; this change makes utilization and revenue math believable immediately.  [oai_citation:5‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

5) **Reallocated 2025 Revenue and COS from pillar level to the practice level** based on billable revenue/cost contribution, and removed the pillar duplicates.  
*Why:* Puts accountability where decisions are made and enables practice P&L rollups.  [oai_citation:6‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

6) **Added hierarchy & insight views:** `v_org_tree`, `v_stream_tree`, `v_rosetta_stone_enhanced`, `v_misattribution_delta`, plus a `v_update_validation` checklist.  
*Why:* Out‑of‑the‑box navigation of org/stream hierarchies, ownership truth table, and a quick build sanity check.  [oai_citation:7‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

> Notes vs. the earlier design text: our original doc proposed optional tables like evidence logs and some example dashboards; those remain good *ideas* but are **not** in the current SQL. This update accurately reflects what’s implemented now and marks those as forward backlog (see §9).  [oai_citation:8‡DatabaseDesign.md](file-service://file-EQz3JyXMKnwYtxWVSnLGNx)

---

## 1) The model in one picture (3+2 streams → atomic units → outcomes)

- **Customer-facing streams:** `WIN`, `DELIVER`, `COLLECT`, and now **`EXPAND`**.  
- **Enablers:** `TALENT`, `OPERATE`.  
- **Atomic units** (the leaves where ownership must be unambiguous):
  - WIN (5), DELIVER (5), COLLECT (3), TALENT (4), OPERATE (3) — the original 20 — plus SELL detail `WINA-*` underneath `WIN` and the new `EXP-01..03`.  
- **Flow:** `TALENT` enables `WIN/DELIVER`; `OPERATE` enables all; `WIN → DELIVER → COLLECT`; `EXPAND` grows existing clients.  
*Why:* This is the minimal structure that exposes fiction vs. reality in ownership and makes drivers and outcomes measurable where the work actually happens.  [oai_citation:9‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 2) Entities & Keys (what exists and why)

### 2.1 Organization & People
- **`org_unit (org_unit_id, code, name, parent_id)`** — Pillars → Departments/COEs → Practices; forms the org tree. Unique `code`.  
  *Why:* Financials, people, and ownership roll up through this tree.  [oai_citation:10‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`org_role (role_id, code, name)`** — Canonical roles (Partner, Practice Lead, Sales Dir, etc.). Unique `code`.  [oai_citation:11‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`person (person_id, full_name, role_id, org_unit_id)`** — Named leaders + seeded staff; supports headcount and per‑person facts.  [oai_citation:12‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 2.2 Value Streams & Units of Work
- **`stream (stream_id, code, name, parent_id, is_enabler, order_in_parent)`** — Top streams (including **EXPAND**) and SELL child streams.  
  *Why:* The value stream is the primary “work spine”. SELL depth is where misattribution often happens.  [oai_citation:13‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`atomic_unit (unit_id, stream_id, code, name, description, order_in_stream)`** — The Rosetta “join row”.  
  *Why:* Every lens (owner, KPIs, systems, $) attaches here — the truth atom we pivot on.  [oai_citation:14‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`unit_hierarchy_link (parent_unit_id, child_unit_id)`** — Links coarse `WIN-*` to detailed `WINA-*`.  
  *Why:* Zoom between 20‑unit exec view and SELL operational view without duplicating metrics.  [oai_citation:15‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 2.3 Ownership (Expected vs. Observed)
- **`unit_expected_ownership (unit_id, accountable_role_id, accountable_org_unit_id, responsible_role_id, responsible_org_unit_id)`** — The official playbook.  
  *Why:* Encodes the **fiction** we’re testing; becomes the comparison baseline.  [oai_citation:16‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`unit_observed_ownership (obs_id, unit_id, observed_as_of, accountable_role_id, accountable_org_unit_id, source, confidence_pct, notes)`** — Append‑only reality.  
  *Why:* Captures who *actually* owns/does the work over time; fuels misattribution analytics.  [oai_citation:17‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

> **Heads‑up:** some expected rows reference roles like `COO`, `CFO`, `CONTROLLER`, `RESOURCE_MGR`. If those codes don’t exist in `org_role`, inserts will fall back to `NULL` (allowed); you can either (a) add these roles to `org_role` or (b) remap to current equivalents (e.g., `DELIVERY_LEAD`).  [oai_citation:18‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 2.4 Systems of Record
- **`system_of_record (sor_id, code, name)`** — CRM, PSA, FIN, HCM, DOC/CLM.  
- **`unit_system (unit_id, sor_id)`** — Where evidence for each unit should live (e.g., WIN→CRM, DELIVER→PSA, COLLECT/OPERATE→FIN, TALENT→HCM; proposal/contract → DOC).  
  *Why:* Ties work to the right system so it is auditable/AI‑learnable.  [oai_citation:19‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 2.5 KPIs & Measurements
- **Enums:** `kpi_kind` (`leading|lagging`), `kpi_scope` (`unit|stream|firm`).  
- **`kpi (kpi_id, code, name, kind, scope, unit_of_measure, north_star)`** — Full dictionary (legacy + operational).  
- **`unit_kpi (unit_id, kpi_id)`** — Which drivers/outcomes a unit controls or contributes to.  
- **`kpi_target (kpi_target_id, kpi_id, scope, [unit_id|stream_id], valid_from, valid_to, target_value, threshold_yellow, threshold_red)`** — Targets by scope/time.  
- **`kpi_measurement (measure_id, kpi_id, [unit_id|stream_id], measured_at, value_numeric, source)`** — Facts (monthly snapshots recommended).  
  *Why:* Clean separation of **controllable drivers** (unit) vs **ends** (stream/firm), with explicit targets and time bounds.  [oai_citation:20‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 2.6 Financials, Rates & People Facts
- **`financial_account (account_id, code, name, category)`** — 2025 budget chart (Revenue, COS, SGA).  [oai_citation:21‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`financial_fact (fact_id, account_id, org_unit_id, period, type, amount)`** — Budget/actuals by org unit.  
  *Why:* Practice‑level P&L rollups become possible (see §4.3).  [oai_citation:22‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`rate_card (role_id, bill_rate, cost_rate)`** — Global fallback by role.  
- **`org_rate_card (org_rate_id, org_unit_id, role_id, bill_rate, cost_rate)`** — **Practice‑specific** rates (e.g., Kyriba vs PMO vs Cloud HCM).  
  *Why:* Margin truth depends on practice‑specific rates; org‑aware rates trump role‑only defaults.  [oai_citation:23‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`person_fact (fact_id, person_id, period, type, billable_hours, cost_amount, bill_rate, cost_rate)`** — Per‑person hours/rates (budget now; actuals later).  
  *Why:* Enables both utilization math and revenue attribution by practice.  [oai_citation:24‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 3) Seeds & Allocation Logic (how the starter data was shaped)

### 3.1 Org & People
- Pillars, departments/COEs, and practices are seeded to reflect the real structure; named leaders are attached; anonymous staff fill in true counts (e.g., Sales team size, Cloud HCM/ERP staffing).  
*Why:* Lets headcount and cost rollups work immediately.  [oai_citation:25‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 3.2 Atomic Units & Ownership
- Top 20 `WIN/DELIVER/COLLECT/TALENT/OPERATE` units are created with descriptions and order; SELL detail `WINA-*` lives under dedicated child streams; expected ownership rows are seeded across WIN and SELL detail.  
*Why:* Establishes the ownership “fiction” to test against observed entries.  [oai_citation:26‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 3.3 KPIs & Targets
- Legacy KPIs (SPI-derived), operational drivers (leading), and outcomes (lagging) are loaded; sample targets are set at unit, stream, and firm scope (e.g., WIN rate 40%, Realization 95%, DSO 45d).  
*Why:* Gives you dials to manage now and outcomes to judge leadership by, later.  [oai_citation:27‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

### 3.4 Financials & Rates
- 2025 budget account lines (Revenue, COS, SGA) are loaded; **practice‑specific** rates added via `org_rate_card`; **external capacity** rows (EACPs/Subs) added for PeopleSoft/Treasury to normalize hours/person.  
- **Revenue & COS reallocation:** billable revenue and cost are computed from `person_fact` × rate, used to **allocate pillar totals down to practices**, and then the **pillar‑level Revenue/COS entries are removed** to avoid double counting.  
*Why:* Puts dollars where accountability lives and yields credible practice P&Ls out of the gate.  [oai_citation:28‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 4) Views (how you navigate, prove truth, and sanity‑check)

- **`v_rosetta_stone`** — For each atomic unit: stream, expected owner (role+org), systems, linked KPIs.  
  *Use:* The simple one‑pager for partner sessions.  [oai_citation:29‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_rosetta_stone_enhanced`** — Adds parent stream names, has_parent/has_children flags (from `unit_hierarchy_link`), and aggregates systems/KPIs.  
  *Use:* Zoom WIN↔SELL and confirm hierarchy wiring.  [oai_citation:30‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_misattribution_delta`** — Compares **expected** vs **latest observed** owners and flags `Aligned / Role Mismatch / Org Mismatch / Not Observed`, with source and confidence.  
  *Use:* “Where the fiction lives” — prioritize fixes.  [oai_citation:31‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_stream_rollup`** — Latest **lagging** outcomes by stream (from `kpi_measurement`).  
  *Use:* Board‑level outcomes.  [oai_citation:32‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_kpi_rollup`** — Mapping from outcomes to their driver KPIs by stream.  
  *Use:* Connects controllables to ends.  [oai_citation:33‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_org_rollup`** — Org node + headcount + 2025 budget rollup + parent hint.  
  *Use:* Practice/COE budget sanity and staffing visibility.  [oai_citation:34‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_financial_rollup`** — Totals by category (Revenue/COS/SGA) per org unit.  
  *Use:* Fast practice P&L lens without pivoting.  [oai_citation:35‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_org_tree` & `v_stream_tree`** — Recursive trees with depth, path, and useful counts (unit counts, linked children, direct revenue/COS/SGA; GM%).  
  *Use:* UI navigation + quick GM % at each node.  [oai_citation:36‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)
- **`v_update_validation`** — Post‑build checks (WIN→SELL link count, EXPAND units, org‑specific rate count, EACP/Sub adds, number of practices with revenue, max hours/person).  
  *Use:* One query smoke test after a fresh build.  [oai_citation:37‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 5) Operating Mechanics — how to use the data in practice

1) **Record reality:** As you interview teams or scrape systems, append `unit_observed_ownership` rows (with `source` and `confidence_pct`). `v_misattribution_delta` will light up the gaps.  
*Outcome:* You can show “who actually makes pricing calls,” “who really manages scope,” etc., with dates and confidence.  [oai_citation:38‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

2) **Load KPI facts monthly:** Push outcomes (WIN rate, avg sold margin, realization, on‑time, utilization, DSO, EBITDA, attrition) into `kpi_measurement`.  
*Outcome:* `v_stream_rollup` and dashboards stop being theoretical and start showing trendlines.  [oai_citation:39‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

3) **Tune targets:** Use `kpi_target` per scope and seasonality; e.g., different `TIME_TO_FILL` targets by practice.  
*Outcome:* Unit owners are judged against realistic, time‑bounded targets.  [oai_citation:40‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

4) **Move dollars to practices:** Keep using practice‑aware rates and maintain financial facts by org unit (`financial_fact`) so practice GM% is visible in `v_org_tree`/`v_financial_rollup`.  
*Outcome:* Accountability sticks at the level where decisions are made.  [oai_citation:41‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 6) Data Governance & Conventions

- **Codes are canonical** (`WIN-03`, `WINA-06`, `SE_CLOUD_HCM`). Use them as join keys in downstream tools.  
- **Enumerations** enforce intent (`kpi_kind`, `kpi_scope`).  
- **Expected vs. observed**: `unit_expected_ownership` defines the RACI fiction; `unit_observed_ownership` is append‑only truth, last‑write wins in views.  
- **Systems mapping** is declarative: it doesn’t enforce workflow; it enforces the *evidence location*.  
- **Rates precedence:** `org_rate_card` (if present) overrides `rate_card`.  
- **Budget vs. Actuals:** `financial_fact.type` and `person_fact.type`. Start with `budget`; add `actual` monthly for real comparisons.  [oai_citation:42‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 7) Build & Runbook

**Load order (idempotent-friendly):**
1. `1-tables_and_types.sql` — schema and enums.  
2. `2-seed.sql` — org tree, roles, people.  
3. `3-value_streams_systems_attribution.sql` — streams, units, ownership, systems.  
4. `4-kpis_and_targets.sql` — KPIs, targets, unit↔KPI mapping.  
5. `5-Financials_rates.sql` — accounts, 2025 budget seeds, rate cards, per‑person facts.  
6. `6-rosetta_stone.sql` — core analytic views.  
7. `7-updates.sql` — production fixes and hierarchy/economic realism.  
8. `SELECT * FROM v_update_validation;` — quick health check.  
*All scripts and the validation view are in the repo bundle.*  [oai_citation:43‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 8) Known Gaps & Practical Fixes

- **Role codes in expected ownership:** If `COO`, `CFO`, `CONTROLLER`, `RESOURCE_MGR` aren’t present, add them to `org_role` or map them to current titles (`DELIVERY_LEAD`, Accounting leadership).  
- **Per‑person cost amounts:** Currently left `NULL` on budget seeds (we compute COS via rates). Load actual cost amounts once ERP integration is ready.  
- **KPI math consistency:** If you want to define stream‑level aggregations from unit drivers, add a small definition table (see backlog below).  [oai_citation:44‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

---

## 9) Backlog (from prior design that isn’t in SQL yet — recommended next)

These were proposed previously and remain valuable; they’re not yet implemented in the SQL, so treat them as near‑term backlog:

1) **Light evidence logs** (3 small tables):
   - `pricing_exception` (WIN‑03): who requested/approved, cycle hours, sold margin.  
   - `change_order_event` (DEL‑04): delta vs billed, who raised/approved.  
   - `recruiting_req` (TAL‑01): opened/filled, openers/fulfillers.  
   *Why:* Tiny data with outsized power to correlate misattribution → leakage → EBITDA.  [oai_citation:45‡DatabaseDesign.md](file-service://file-EQz3JyXMKnwYtxWVSnLGNx)

2) **KPI rollup definition** (optional): a table that documents how stream outcomes are derived from unit drivers (avg, weighted avg, sum).  
   *Why:* Makes rollup math explicit and changeable without rewriting views.  [oai_citation:46‡DatabaseDesign.md](file-service://file-EQz3JyXMKnwYtxWVSnLGNx)

3) **Hotspot dashboards** as views (`v_misattribution_hotspots`, `v_outcomes_dashboard`, `v_stream_health`) if you want pre‑canned summaries beyond the current views.  
   *Why:* Meeting‑ready summaries for partners/board.  [oai_citation:47‡DatabaseDesign.md](file-service://file-EQz3JyXMKnwYtxWVSnLGNx)

---

## 10) Why this design fits our operating standard

- **Business outcomes first:** Practice‑level P&L and stream outcomes are visible; ownership clarity reduces heroics.  
- **Delivered capabilities always:** All joins (owner, system, KPI, $) sit on the atomic unit so views and UI can pivot instantly.  
- **Fact‑anchored:** Seeds reflect the actual org, units, KPIs, accounts, rates, and production fixes in code — not slides.  [oai_citation:48‡repomix-output.txt](file-service://file-57UgWP4FZVAErrZv544sT8)

# The Value Stream



```
ENABLERS: Talent (people/skills)  •  Operate (tools/process/admin)

1) SELL (“Win the right work at the right price”)
   - Understand the client’s problem
   - Shape a solution we can actually deliver
   - Set price and terms we can live with

2) DELIVER (“Do the work as promised”)
   - Staff the team
   - Control changes (change orders)
   - Hit dates and quality

3) COLLECT (“Turn work into cash”)
   - Bill cleanly and on time
   - Fix invoice issues fast
   - Drive down days to cash

4) EXPAND (“Grow the relationship”)
   - Earn advocacy
   - Land follow-on work the team can deliver profitably
```

Each step has a few **small, concrete pieces of work** (think: “shape the solution,” “set the price,” “capture scope changes”) with one **clearly accountable owner**. These are the jobs where decision rights must sit.

# Misattribution (why we lose money)

- **What’s happening:** Sales-step work is landing on Delivery leaders (solution shaping, pricing, even approvals). Delivery-step work like change-order capture is inconsistent.
- **Why it matters:**
  - When Delivery shapes solutions and helps Sales price, the deal “wins”—but we lose margin later.
  - When change orders aren’t captured in Delivery, we give away free work.
  - When invoices bounce in Collect, cash slows and time goes to firefighting.

**The fix:** Put each decision back where it belongs, and measure the few dials that prove it’s working.

# The Dials (you can move these weekly)

- **Sales (SELL) dials:**
  - How long it takes to get a real solution outline approved
  - How often we discount and how long discount approvals take
- **Delivery (DELIVER) dials:**
  - How much scope we capture instead of giving away (“% of changes turned into change orders”)
  - Hitting dates (on-time delivery rate)
- **Collect (COLLECT) dials:**
  - Invoice error rate
  - Days to cash
- **Enablers:**
  - Time to fill a role
  - % of people aligned to the right skills

These dials roll up to the outcomes we care about: **win rate, sold margin, realization (did we keep the margin), on-time delivery, and DSO (cash speed).**

# **The AI Lens: From Organizational Chaos to AI-Ready Excellence**

## **The Revelation That Changes Everything**

*"If we can't operationalize everything, then our organization itself cannot be an AI-first organization."*

This isn't abstract theory. This is the lens that finally explains why Cloud Enterprise COE and On Premise COE generate 70% of Elire's revenue yet we're at negative margins. Why Cloud is growing at 40% year-over-year yet our overall revenue has been flat at $29M for two years. Why we work harder than ever but fall further behind.

AI doesn't care about our org chart, our politics, or our good intentions. It only asks: "Can I enhance this work?" And when you examine Elire through that lens, everything becomes clear.

## **Part I: The AI Imperative**

### **The 18-24 Month Window**

Right now, our competitors are feeding their defined processes to AI. Every project teaches their AI patterns. Every estimate gets more accurate. Every risk becomes more predictable. Every junior performs more like a senior.

Industry research shows firms achieving AI enhancement see 30-40% productivity improvements within 18 months. But the window for achieving that enhancement is closing fast.

Meanwhile, we're relying on heroics that AI cannot learn from, tribal knowledge that AI cannot access, and undefined work that AI cannot enhance.

### **Their Reality vs Our Reality**

**AI-Enabled Competitors:**

- AI guides their sales teams through complex solutioning
- AI predicts project risks before they materialize
- AI optimizes resource allocation across projects
- AI helps juniors perform like seniors from day one

**Our Reality:**

- Every solution starts from scratch
- Every estimate is a best guess
- Every project discovers its own risks
- Heroes compensating for lack of systems

The gap compounds daily. Every project they complete feeds their AI more data. Every project we complete through heroics teaches our AI nothing.

## **Part II: What the AI Lens Reveals About Elire**

### **The Organizational Truth**

We don't actually know what our organization is. We have high-level pillar structures. We have COE leadership. But we don't have a comprehensive organizational chart with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. When you map who actually does what work, you discover our organizational structure is elaborate fiction maintained by exhausted heroes.

This isn't just an HR problem. This is an AI impossibility. AI cannot enhance an organization it cannot understand.

### **The Revenue Concentration Reality**

Cloud Enterprise COE and On Premise COE together generate 70% of Elire's revenue, managed by just 2 partners—Jeff and myself. Add EPM and we're at 82%. This concentration reveals a deeper truth: these aren't just delivery practices—they've become entire businesses within the business, absorbing every function required for success.

### **The "Can We Discount?" Moment That Reveals Everything**

Here's a simple question that happens every week: "Can we discount this deal by 10%?"

In theory, this should be straightforward. Client Relations should know if the relationship justifies it. Finance should know if we can afford it. Delivery should confirm we can still deliver quality. The decision gets made, we move forward.

But here's what actually happens:

The question goes to delivery—specifically to Jeff or me—because we're the only ones who can actually answer it. Why? Because that 10% discount touches everything:

- **Technical implications**: Can we still deliver the full scope? What corners would we need to cut?
- **Resource implications**: Will we need cheaper resources? Can we use more offshore? Will our best people still want to work on it?
- **Risk implications**: Does the discount mean we can't afford proper testing? Will we skip knowledge transfer?
- **Timeline implications**: Can we compress phases? Will we need to overlap activities?
- **Quality implications**: What deliverables become "good enough" vs "excellent"?
- **Relationship implications**: Will the client expect this discount forever? On every project?
- **Margin implications**: Not just the obvious 10%, but the hidden costs of all the above compromises

Delivery makes this call because we live with every consequence of that decision. Sales gets their commission on the discounted rate and moves on. Finance records the final margin after the project disaster. But delivery owns every compromise, every risk, every late night that 10% discount creates.

This isn't dysfunction—it's evolved reality. But it's reality that makes AI enhancement impossible.

## **Part III: The Atomic Unit Discovery**

### **The Bridge from Chaos to Clarity**

**Atomic units**—the smallest definable, measurable unit of work that cannot be broken down further while still maintaining business meaning.

This isn't about creating more process. It's about making what we already do visible to AI. Because AI can only augment what it can understand.

### **Don't Map Your Mess, Design Your Future**

We could try to map our current state—document everything we do today. This would be fatal. Our current state includes dysfunction that made sense when we were smaller but now blocks AI enhancement.

Instead, we must use atomic units to discover our operational reality. Not to prescribe solutions, but to reveal truth.

## **Part IV: The Uncomfortable Truths - What The Discovery Will Force Us to Confront**

The atomic unit discovery won't just reveal gaps—it will expose how our entire organizational structure is elaborate fiction, with 70% of the firm's real work falling on two COE leads and their leadership teams while four pillars report green metrics for work they don't actually do.

### **Redefining the Sales and Delivery Partnership**

Client Relations reports their success: "Pipeline at 3x coverage!" "$50M in qualified opportunities!" "30% win rate!" They benchmark against industry standards, hire BDRs based on ratios, get bonused on bookings.

**But here's what actually happens:**

Every piece of real sales work falls to the COE leads and their practice leaders. Solutioning? The COE teams write it at night. Estimating? Aaron, John, Jason, Arjun build it between client meetings. Pricing decisions? That 10% discount question goes to Jeff or me because we understand all the implications. Technical presentations? The practice leads deliver them while sales takes notes. RFP responses? The COE teams write them over weekends.

Sales schedules the meetings. COE leaders make them valuable. Sales sends the emails. Delivery writes the content. Sales tracks the pipeline. COE teams qualify what's real. Sales celebrates the win. Delivery figures out how to deliver it.

**The structural cascade:** They hire more sales reps based on "pipeline coverage" metrics. Each new rep creates more burden on COE teams—more discovery calls for practice leads to lead, more proposals for delivery to write, more estimates for technical leaders to build. The bottleneck isn't pipeline; it's delivery leadership's capacity to do sales' job while delivering 70% of revenue.

**The measurement fraud:** Sales reports "$50M pipeline" but COE leaders know only $15M is real. They report "30% win rate" but that's because delivery only pursues what they can actually deliver. Sales gets commissioned on work that COE teams create while doing it for free at 85%+ utilization.

**The Win-Win Opportunity:** When we map atomic units, Client Relations can finally see which activities truly drive revenue. They can focus on high-value relationship building while AI handles the technical solutioning that currently burdens COE teams. Both groups win—sales gets to do actual sales, COEs get to stop doing sales work for free.

### **Bridging the Systemic Gaps in Our Talent Lifecycle**

Talent reports their metrics: "45-day time-to-fill!" "2,000 training hours!" "Utilization at 78%!" They benchmark against SHRM, get bonused on hiring velocity.

**But here's what actually happens:**

Workforce planning? That falls to each COE lead. Not Talent's job apparently. COE leaders project needs while drowning in delivery. Job descriptions? COE teams write them at 11pm because Talent doesn't know what's needed. Screening? Talent checks for keywords. Aaron, John, Jason, Arjun, and the other practice leads determine if candidates can actually do the work. Pipeline? There is no pipeline. Just panic hiring when COEs are desperate. Onboarding? The practice leads do it while billing full-time. Development? COE leaders mentor at midnight between project crises.

**The structural cascade:** No workforce planning means every hire is an emergency. Emergency hiring means COEs take whoever exists. Bad hires mean senior practitioners cover the gaps. Coverage burden means burnout. Burnout means resignation. Resignation means emergency hiring. The cycle accelerates.

**The measurement fraud:** Talent reports "positions filled" for roles COE leaders defined, candidates practice leads evaluated, people delivery teams onboard. They report "training delivered" that doesn't create billing capability. They report "78% utilization" without showing COE leaders are drowning at 95% while carrying Talent's responsibilities.

**The Win-Win Opportunity:** Atomic unit clarity will give Talent the precise skill definitions they need to actually source and develop talent. They can build real pipelines, create meaningful development programs, and actually add value instead of just processing paperwork. COE teams get freed from HR work they shouldn't be doing.

### **Closing the Gap Between Financial Data and Operational Decisions**

Finance reports their precision: "Month-end close in 3 days!" "Forecast accuracy within 5%!" "All projects have margin reports!" They benchmark against CFO surveys, get bonused on reporting speed.

**But here's what actually happens:**

Real-time margin visibility? Doesn't exist. COE leaders make pricing decisions blind. Project profitability? Delivery finds out after it's over. Resource costs? Practice leads guess based on outdated rates. Burn rate? COE teams calculate it themselves on napkins. Investment decisions? Delivery leaders make them without financial insight.

That 10% discount decision? COE leads make it without knowing if they can afford it. That resource addition? Practice leads approve it without knowing the margin impact. That scope change? Delivery accepts it without understanding the financial consequence.

**The structural cascade:** No real-time visibility means decisions are guesses. Bad financial decisions mean margin erosion. Margin erosion means heroic recovery efforts by COE teams. Heroic efforts mean burnout. Burnout means higher costs. Higher costs mean worse margins. Finance reports it all six weeks later.

**The measurement fraud:** Finance reports "accurate forecasts" based on assumptions COE leaders gave them. They report "margin analysis" after projects end. They report "financial controls" while delivery makes million-dollar decisions without financial data.

**The Win-Win Opportunity:** When work is defined at the atomic level, Finance can finally provide real-time operational intelligence. They become strategic partners instead of historians. COE teams get the financial visibility they desperately need to make informed decisions.

### **PMO's Evolving Challenge**

PMO is our newest addition, still finding its footing. The intent is right - professional services firms need project governance. But right now, we're in an awkward adolescence where PMO adds process without yet having the context to add value.

PMO reports their diligence: "All projects have status reports!" "Risk registers updated weekly!" They're doing what PMO is supposed to do.

**But here's the current reality:**

Because PMO is new and still learning our technical landscape, COE teams end up doing dual work - their actual project management plus PMO's process requirements. We are shaping this with them in our free time. There isn't a methodology yet and our cloud delivery methodology continues to evolve as Oracle quickly evolves.

This isn't PMO's fault - they're building something important. But right now, they're a layer that adds burden without removing any from COE teams.

**The Win-Win Opportunity:** The atomic unit discovery will help PMO understand what project management actually requires in our context, helping them evolve from overhead to value-add. They can build methodologies that actually reflect how we deliver, not generic templates from other companies.

### **The Devastating Cumulative Reality**

When you add it all up, here's what COE leadership teams actually do for 82% of the firm's revenue:

**Sales work they shouldn't do:**

- Solution architecture
- Effort estimation
- Pricing decisions
- Technical presentations
- RFP responses
- Opportunity qualification
- Client relationships

**Talent work they shouldn't do:**

- Workforce planning
- Job descriptions
- Technical interviews
- Onboarding
- Performance management
- Career development

**Finance work they shouldn't do:**

- Margin analysis
- Investment decisions
- Resource cost modeling
- Project profitability tracking

**PMO work they shouldn't do:**

- Project management
- Risk mitigation
- Issue resolution
- Developing methodology
- Scope management
- Quality assurance

**Plus their actual job:**

- Delivering projects
- Managing client relationships
- Ensuring quality
- Building intellectual property
- Growing the practice

### **The Structural Impossibility**

Each pillar has industry benchmarks, metrics, bonuses. They hire people, run meetings, create reports. But when atomic units reveal who actually does the work, we'll discover:

**Either the pillars take their atomic units back:** Which means massive capability building, different people, new operating models, and actual accountability for outcomes.

**Or we acknowledge reality:** The COEs ARE the business. The pillars are expensive overhead. And we should structure, fund, and staff accordingly.

**Or we continue the fiction:** The pillars keep reporting green metrics. COE leaders and their teams keep drowning. The firm keeps wondering why 70% of revenue operates at negative margins despite heroic effort.

**The Win-Win Resolution:** But there's a fourth path—the one the pilot will reveal. Once we see who actually does what work, we can design a structure where everyone wins. The pillars can focus on what they're actually good at. COE teams can stop doing four jobs. AI can enhance everyone's work. Margins improve. Burnout disappears. Growth accelerates.

### **Why AI Makes This Confrontation Inevitable**

AI doesn't care about our org chart. It can't learn from work that isn't defined. It can't enhance responsibilities that aren't owned. It can't optimize processes that don't exist.

When we map atomic units, AI will force the question: Who actually owns this work?

And when the answer is "the COE leadership teams doing everything while four pillars report metrics," AI will expose the fiction we've been maintaining.

The atomic unit discovery isn't about reorganization. It's about revelation. And that revelation will show that our organizational structure is elaborate theater while exhausted COE teams carry 82% of the firm on their backs.

The question isn't whether this is sustainable—it's not. The question is whether we'll fix it voluntarily or wait for the COE leadership teams to burn out and watch 82% of revenue collapse.

AI doesn't care about our comfort. It only cares about clarity. And clarity will reveal that our pillars are fictional, our metrics are theater, and our organizational structure is a lie we tell ourselves while delivery does everything.

**But here's the liberating truth:** Once we face this reality, everyone's job gets easier. The discovery isn't about blame—it's about liberation from undefined work, unclear ownership, and impossible expectations.

## **Part V: The Cloud and On-Premise Pilot**

### **Why Both COEs Must Lead**

This is critical: We must pilot with BOTH Cloud Enterprise COE AND On-Premise COE. Jeff and I experience very similar challenges—both in the burden and the frustration our leaders are sharing. Together, we represent 70% of firm revenue. If we can make these two practices AI-ready, the rest follows.

### **The 90-Day Discovery Process**

**Days 1-30: Document Reality**
 Map every atomic unit both practices actually perform. Not what the org chart says, but what really happens. Every piece of work—defined or undefined, official or unofficial.

**Days 31-60: Assess AI Readiness**
 For each atomic unit discovered: Can AI enhance this today? What's blocking AI from helping? Who should own it for AI to be effective?

**Days 61-90: Test Enhancement**
 Run both COEs with AI assistance wherever possible. Document where AI could help if work was better defined. Measure the impact. Calculate the opportunity cost.

### **What We'll Likely Discover**

We don't know what we'll find, but we'll likely discover:

- **Capability Voids**: Work that no one outside delivery can perform
- **Functional Overlaps**: Multiple groups doing the same work differently
- **Hidden Dependencies**: Atomic units requiring deep technical knowledge
- **Margin Leaks**: Unbillable work explaining our negative margins despite growth

These discoveries will reveal reality. And reality, viewed through the AI lens, will make the path forward obvious.

## **Part VI: Three Futures We Face**

### **Future 1: The AI-Irrelevant Path**

We discover the gaps but lack the will to close them. We continue operating through heroics while competitors deploy AI that makes them 50% more efficient. Our heroes burn out trying to compete against AI-augmented competitors.

### **Future 2: The AI-Disrupted Path**

We make surface changes but don't achieve the atomic clarity AI requires. A new entrant uses AI to completely reimagine professional services delivery. They offer Oracle Cloud implementations at 30% of our cost with better quality.

### **Future 3: The AI-Leadership Path**

We achieve atomic clarity in the next 12 months. We deploy AI that multiplies our expertise. Every junior performs like a senior with AI guidance. Every senior's expertise scales across the entire organization.

What this looks like in 18 months: Every estimate accurate. Project risks identified before they occur. Juniors delivering senior-quality work. Positive margins. Zero burnout.

## **Part VII: The Partnership Decision**

### **What This Transformation Requires**

**1. Courage to Discover**
 Authorize the 90-day Cloud and On-Premise pilot. Accept that we might not like what we find.

**2. Commitment to Truth**
 When the discovery reveals gaps, voids, and fictions, resist the urge to explain them away.

**3. Urgency in Action**
 The window is 18 months. Every month of delay is competitive advantage lost forever.

### **The Personal Context**

Jeff and I have been carrying 70% of the firm's revenue while doing work that extends far beyond delivery. We have a maniacal desire to get this right but we are drowning in work. For me personally, this isn't sustainable stress—this is organizational dysfunction manifesting as personal crisis.

The compensation model journey that started last fall brought us here. I couldn't articulate the root causes then. The AI readiness lens provides that clarity.

## **The Final Word**

We stand at an inflection point. We're working harder than ever but revenue is flat. The model that got us here—undefined work, unclear ownership, heroic effort—cannot take us forward.

AI provides both the lens to see our reality and the imperative to change it. The atomic unit framework gives us the method. The 90-day pilot proves it works. The 18-month window demands we act.

The question isn't whether AI will transform professional services—it's whether we'll use AI or be replaced by it.

The uncomfortable truths aren't comfortable. But they're also opportunities. Every gap we discover is a chance to improve. Every fiction we expose is a chance to build something real. Every burden we identify is a chance to redistribute it fairly.

This isn't about tearing down what we've built. It's about evolving it for the AI age. And that evolution benefits everyone—the pillars get clarity, the COEs get relief, and Elire gets a future.

The framework is complete. The pilot is defined. The urgency is undeniable.

The choice—and the future it creates—is ours.

The time for clarity is now.

# DesignDecisions.md — `elire_ops_1`

*A companion to the SQL build+seed that explains assumptions, mappings, allocations, and how to evolve the dataset as you replace placeholders with actuals.*

------

## 0) Purpose & framing

This database implements your “**Rosetta Stone**” vision: each **atomic unit** is a join row that connects **Value Streams**, **Org/Pillars/COEs/Practices/People**, **KPIs** (leading vs. lagging), **Systems of Record**, and **Financials** so you can pivot the same truth through different hierarchies and see **ownership, accountability, and outcomes** in one place. This is anchored to your real Elire organization (*Elire.md*), your current KPI set (*Analysis.md*), and your modeling of SELL sub-stages and RACI patterns (*Modeling Ideas.md*).

------

## 1) Hierarchy model decisions

### 1.1 Value Stream tree

- **Streams (L1)**: `WIN`, `DELIVER`, `COLLECT`, `TALENT`, `OPERATE` (Customer-facing; Enablers). This is the primary spine for the Rosetta Stone. It matches the 3+2 model we agreed and your enumerated 20 atomic units.
- **SELL detail**: Additional **child streams** under `WIN`—`WIN_LEAD`, `WIN_REGISTER`, `WIN_TRIAGE`, `WIN_QUALIFY`, `WIN_OUTLINE`, `WIN_PRICE`, `WIN_PROPOSAL`, `WIN_NEGOTIATE`, `WIN_HANDOFF`—let you toggle coarse (20 units) vs. fine (SELL phases). Atomic units in these match your Modeling Ideas doc (Targeting, Deal Registration, Triage, Qualification, Solution Outline, Pricing, Proposal, Negotiation, Handoff).

**Why**: The value stream is the canonical “flow of work” lens. SELL is the most misattributed area (COEs doing sales work), so a deeper layer ensures you can demonstrate where ownership and cycle time are lost.

### 1.2 Org tree (truth in the tree)

- **Pillars (L1)**: `Leadership`, `Client Relationships`, `Service Execution`, `Talent`, `Finance & Operations`.
- **Departments (L2)**: under Client Relationships: `Sales`, `Marketing`, `Proposal Mgmt/Contracts`; under Finance & Ops: `Accounting`, `IT`; under Talent: `HR`, `Recruiting`; under Service Execution: **COEs** (MAS, EPM, Cloud Enterprise, Solution Center, On Premise, Treasury).
- **Practices (L3)**: e.g., MAS→`PMO` + `SAS`; EPM→`Planning & Analytics` + `Close & Consolidations`; Cloud Enterprise→`Cloud HCM`, `Cloud ERP`, `Cloud Technology`; Solution Center→`Managed Services`; On Premise→`PeopleSoft Practice`; Treasury→`Kyriba SaaS Treasury`, `PeopleSoft Treasury`.
- **People (L4)**: every **named leader** (Friend, Maske, Landon, Surma, Tavia, Richard, Chris, John, Jason, Arjun, Brian, Jeff, Ryan, Ed, Alex, Scott, Carlos, Abdel, Al, Edmund, Stephen, Maddie, Tim, Jake) seeded and attached to their real unit/role. Anonymous rows created where counts were given (e.g., **Sales team 11** → 2 named + 9 anonymous; **Cloud HCM 14** → 1 named + 13 anonymous) so headcount, costs, and hours roll up.

**Why**: You said “the app must show the truth.” Accountability must be visible at **department/practice level** where it currently isn’t explicitly defined; the tree structure allows rollups role→department→practice→COE→pillar→CEO.

------

## 2) Rosetta Stone join row

Each **atomic unit** (e.g., “WIN-03 Pricing & Margin Decision”) carries:

- **Stream** (e.g., `WIN`) and optional **SELL sub-stream**.
- **Expected Owner** (both a **role** and an **org unit**) — e.g., Sales Director at Client Relationships/Sales. (*Observed owner intentionally left blank for your UI*).
- **Systems**: where evidence should live — e.g., `CRM` (`WIN`), `PSA` (`DELIVER`), `FIN` (`COLLECT`, `OPERATE`), `HCM` (`TALENT`), `DOC`(`WIN-04`, `WIN-05`).
- **KPIs**: leading (controllables) and lagging (outcomes) linked at the unit (leading) or stream (lagging) level.
- **Financial link**: via org unit to budget accounts and per-person facts.

**Why**: This is the pivot that lets you view the same reality by **Value Stream** or by **Org tree** or by **Financial** or **KPI** and see the **same unit** telling the same story, just from a different angle.

------

## 3) Expected vs observed ownership

- **Expected** is pre-seeded from org/role responsibilities (Sales owns Qualification, Proposal owns Proposal, Legal owns Contract, PM/Delivery own Scope/Change, etc.).
- **Observed** (misattribution) is **blank** so your UI can capture reality — e.g., **COEs** actually doing Discovery, Pricing, and Proposal; **Sales** negotiating Scope mid-delivery; **Talent** work unowned. This matches your AI Lens (“Delivery makes the call”, “COEs write it”, “AEs renegotiate scope mid-delivery”, “Recruiting ad hoc”).

**Why**: You asked to do misattribution entry yourself to drive UI adoption and make deltas obvious (fiction vs truth).

------

## 4) KPI set & targets

### 4.1 “Current KPIs” (as-is)

- The full list you track today (SPI-derived) is seeded for **transparency**: pipeline coverage, SOW closed, RFP win rate, utilization, attrition, invoice rework, etc.
- Many are **lagging** and some are **perception-based** (SPI leadership index). We store them to reflect your **current state**—and so you can later compare against **operational drivers**.

### 4.2 “Operational KPIs” (the drivers+outcomes you’ll manage)

- **Leading** (unit-level, controllable):
  - `LEAD_RESP_TIME`, `QUAL_COMPLETE`, `OUTLINE_VALID`, `DISCOUNT_CYCLE`, `PROPOSAL_REUSE`, `HANDOFF_COMPLETE`, `TIME_TO_STAFF`, `SCOPE_CAPTURE`, `INVOICE_ERR`, `TIME_TO_FILL`, `CERTS_PER_FTE`, `PLAN_ACCURACY_90D`.
- **Lagging** (stream/firm outcomes):
  - `WIN_RATE`, `AVG_SOLD_MARGIN`, `REALIZATION`, `ON_TIME`, `UTILIZATION`, `DSO`, `EBITDA`, `ATTRITION`.

**Targets** seeded from SPI/market norms and your budget posture (*e.g.*, Utilization 75% target, Realization 95%, On-time 90%, DSO 45 days, Win-rate 40%). You can tune these targets in-app.

------

## 5) Financial model (2025 budget)

### 5.1 Accounts

- All accounts in your 2025 budget (revenue, COS, SG&A, etc.) are loaded with **codes 4000–8900** and **amounts**exactly as you published, classified into `Revenue`, `COS`, `SGA` categories.

### 5.2 Facts

- `financial_fact`: a single **2025** period with `type='budget'`, **tied to org units** so they roll up practice→COE→pillar→firm. You can later add `type='actual'` for budget vs actual.

### 5.3 Per-person facts

- `person_fact`: seeded with **2025 billable hours** and **rate assumptions** per person.
  - For **Delivery practices** where hours and average bill rates were given, we **divide total hours evenly** among all billable roles in the practice (Consultants, PM, Partners/Assoc Partners leading that practice) and assign the **avg bill rate** to each. **Cost rate** comes from `rate_card`.
  - Example allocations (hours & avg bill rate from Elire.md):
    - Cloud HCM: 41,462 hrs @ $168/hr across John + 13 consultants → ~2,962 hrs/person @ $168/hr.
    - Cloud ERP: 22,826 hrs @ $170/hr across Jason + 7 consultants → ~2,853 hrs/person @ $170/hr.
    - Cloud Tech: 11,520 hrs @ $180/hr across Arjun + 3 consultants → ~2,880 hrs/person @ $180/hr.
    - EPM Planning: 18,290 hrs @ $168/hr across Alex + 3 consultants → ~4,572 hrs/person @ $168/hr.
    - EPM Close: 12,796 hrs @ $165/hr across Scott + 4 consultants → ~2,559 hrs/person @ $165/hr.
    - On Prem PeopleSoft: 59,595 hrs @ $178/hr across Ryan + 6 consultants → ~8,513 hrs/person @ $178/hr.
    - MAS PMO: 2,600 hrs @ $194/hr across Edmund + 2 consultants → ~867 hrs/person @ $194/hr.
    - MAS SAS: 6,901 hrs @ $176/hr across Stephen + 3 consultants → ~1,725 hrs/person @ $176/hr.
    - Treasury Kyriba: 11,210 hrs @ $205/hr across Abdel + 3 consultants → ~2,802 hrs/person @ $205/hr.
    - Treasury PSFT: 8,751 hrs @ $194/hr across Al + 1 consultant → ~4,375 hrs/person @ $194/hr.

> **Important**: these **per-person seeds are placeholders** to make the rollups match your 2025 totals immediately. You will overwrite with **PSA actuals** over time (same table, `type='actual'`).

------

## 6) Systems of Record mapping

- WIN units → `CRM` (with `DOC` for proposal/contract; `PSA` also for pricing guardrails).
- DELIVER units → `PSA`.
- COLLECT + OPERATE → `FIN`.
- TALENT → `HCM`.

**Why**: This enforces “evidence lives where it should” and supports the AI-ready standard (“AI can’t learn from undefined work”).

------

## 7) What’s intentionally **left blank** (for your UI)

- **Observed ownership** (`unit_observed_ownership`) — you will set who actually owns each unit today. This is where misattribution becomes visible (COE doing pricing, Sales doing scope, Talent unowned).
- **Actuals** (`financial_fact.type='actual'`, `person_fact.type='actual'`) — load from PSA/ERP to measure budget vs actual.

------

## 8) How to validate and iterate (checklist)

### 8.1 Immediate checks

- `select * from v_rosetta_stone order by stream, unit_code;`
  Ensure each atomic unit shows expected role + org unit, systems, and linked KPIs.
- `select * from v_org_rollup;`
  Confirm headcount and 2025 budget are rolling to practice → COE → pillar as expected.
- `select * from v_financial_rollup;`
  Verify Revenue, COS, and SG&A totals match *Elire.md* summary lines.
- `select * from v_stream_rollup;`
  Ensure lagging KPIs appear per stream (values will be null until you load measurements).

### 8.2 Replace placeholders with actuals

- **Observed ownership**: update via UI to expose fiction vs reality and drive RACI conversations.
- **Actual hours and cost/revenue**: insert into `person_fact` with `type='actual'` from your PSA.
- **Actual financials**: insert into `financial_fact` with `type='actual'` from ERP by month/quarter.

### 8.3 Tighten KPIs

- Use your current SPI KPIs (as-is) for continuity; manage with **operational drivers** (leading) to move outcomes (lagging).
- As you operationalize your approach, tune **targets** and add derived **stream KPI measurements** (into `kpi_measurement`) to populate `v_stream_rollup`.

------

## 9) Risks & mitigation

- **Org changes** (new practices/coEs): the org tree is flexible (`parent_id`). Add nodes and reassign people; rollups will follow.
- **Per-person budgeting**: seeded averages may hide variance. Mitigate by loading actuals per person ASAP.
- **KPI overload**: you wanted **all current KPIs** seeded; use **views** and **UI filters** to focus on drivers + outcomes while the legacy set remains visible.
- **Attribution ambiguity**: expected owners don’t reflect reality; that’s intentional. Fill `unit_observed_ownership`via the UI and use the views to show deltas.

------

## 10) “Where to go from here” (roadmap)

1. **UI: Observed ownership** — build the inline editor on `unit_observed_ownership`; instantly show differences in the Rosetta Stone and misattribution hotspots.
2. **Actuals: PSA/ERP** — start loading `person_fact(type='actual')` and `financial_fact(type='actual')`(monthly).
3. **Driver dashboards** — render leading KPI dials (`DISCOUNT_CYCLE`, `SCOPE_CAPTURE`, `TIME_TO_FILL`) at atomic-unit level; pin to targets.
4. **Outcome dashboards** — render lagging KPI dials (`WIN_RATE`, `REALIZATION`, `ON_TIME`, `DSO`, `EBITDA`); correlate with drivers.
5. **Decision rights & guardrails** — codify discount guardrails; define scope change authority; make ownership hard at department/practice level and reflect it in expected ownership.
6. **Retire survey theater** — keep SPI’s leadership index for continuity; judge leadership by **ends** (EBITDA, realization, on-time) and **drivers** they actively manage.

------

## 11) Files used (anchor citations)

- **Elire Operating Model – Current State 2025** (org tree, leaders, headcount, practices, budget lines, hours, rates).
- **Analysis.md** (current KPI set, hierarchy intent, value streams, RACI roll-up concept).
- **Modeling Ideas.md** (SELL sub-stages, expected vs observed patterns, Owner test, North-star mapping).

------

## 12) What to update when your data changes

- **Org**: insert/update `org_unit`, `person`, and `org_role` rows (the trees update).
- **Expected ownership**: adjust `unit_expected_ownership` as you clarify RACI.
- **Observed ownership**: append to `unit_observed_ownership` with timestamps from your UI.
- **KPIs**: maintain `kpi` rows and `kpi_target`; load measurements into `kpi_measurement`.
- **Budget**: insert new `financial_fact` rows for new periods (e.g., `type='budget'` for 2026).
- **Actuals**: load `financial_fact(type='actual')` and `person_fact(type='actual')` by period.

------

### Final note

This design deliberately **does not overcomplicate the schema**, but it **does** encode the critical connections you asked for so that **trees, rollups, and attribution** appear naturally once you start editing observed ownership and loading actuals. It is purpose-built to **prove** the story you’ve been telling: *who really owns the work, how that affects outcomes and dollars, and where to move accountability so leadership is measured by ends and controllable drivers—not by surveys or anecdotes.*

# Rosetta Console v4.0 - Data-Driven Hierarchical UI

A PostgreSQL-backed web application that reveals **fiction vs reality** through hierarchical trees showing ownership alignment, with the database structure driving all business logic and rollups.

## 🎯 Core Vision

**THE DATABASE IS THE SOLUTION** - UI is just a thin visualization layer over properly structured SQL views. All rollups, hierarchies, and relationships are calculated in the database, not JavaScript.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database connection in .env.local
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user@localhost:5432/elire_ops_1

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:3000
```

## 📊 Key Pages - Hierarchical Trees with Rollups

### 🌳 **Organization Tree** (`/org`) 
Navigate the org hierarchy with ownership alignment rollups:
- **Structure**: Pillars → COEs → Practices
- **Metrics**: Headcount, Revenue, Margin, Ownership Alignment
- **Rollups**: See how misattribution cascades up the org tree
- **Data Source**: `v_org_tree_with_ownership` view

### 🔀 **Value Streams** (`/streams`)
Editable ownership at the atomic unit level:
- **Structure**: Streams → Sub-streams → Atomic Units  
- **Editing**: Click "Click to set" to assign ownership with dropdowns
- **Real-time**: Changes immediately update rollups
- **Data Source**: `v_stream_tree_with_ownership` view

### 📋 **Truth Table** (`/truth`)
Paginated grid view for bulk operations:
- Expected vs Observed ownership comparison
- Filtering by stream, org, or status
- Pagination for large datasets

### Other Pages
- **Evidence Log** (`/evidence`) — Audit trail of all changes
- **KPIs** (`/kpis`) — Leading/lagging metrics  
- **Finance** (`/finance`) — P&L views (direct and allocated)

## 🏗️ Architecture - Database-Driven Design

### Critical Principle: WBS-Style Strict Hierarchies
```
Organization Hierarchy:         Stream Hierarchy:
    LEADERSHIP                      WIN
    ├── PILLAR_SERVICE_EXEC         ├── WIN_LEAD
    │   ├── SERVICE_CLOUD           ├── WIN_REGISTER
    │   └── SERVICE_DATA            ├── WIN_TRIAGE
    └── PILLAR_CLIENT               └── WIN_QUALIFY...
        ├── CLIENT_SALES        
        └── CLIENT_MARKETING    Atomic Units (at leaves):
                                   - WIN-01: Lead Generation
                                   - WIN-02: Lead Registration
                                   - etc.
```

### Database Views Handle Everything
```sql
-- Org tree with ownership rollups (calculated in SQL)
v_org_tree_with_ownership

-- Stream tree with unit ownership details  
v_stream_tree_with_ownership

-- Truth table with status calculation
v_rosetta_truth
```

### API Endpoints Are Simple Passthroughs
```javascript
// GOOD - Simple passthrough to database view
const result = await query('SELECT * FROM v_org_tree_with_ownership');

// BAD - Calculating rollups in JavaScript
const rollup = nodes.reduce((sum, node) => sum + node.value, 0);
```

## 🔧 Database Setup

Run these SQL scripts in order:
```bash
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/1-tables_and_types.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/2-seed.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/3-value_streams_systems_attribution.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/4-kpis_and_targets.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/5-Financials_rates.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/6-rosetta_stone.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/7-updates.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/8-updates.sql
psql -d elire_ops_1 -f elire_ops_1/10-ui-helpers.sql
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Tree/Hierarchy Endpoints (READ-ONLY)
- `GET /api/tree/org-with-ownership` — Org tree with ownership stats
- `GET /api/tree/streams-with-ownership` — Stream tree with ownership stats
- `GET /api/streams/[code]/units` — Units for a specific stream

### Data Modification (WRITE)
- `POST /api/observed-ownership` — Set observed ownership (append-only)
- `POST /api/evidence` — Log evidence entries

### Option Lists
- `GET /api/options/org` — Organization dropdown options
- `GET /api/options/role` — Role dropdown options

## 🎨 UI Components

### StreamTreeWithUnits
The core component for editable hierarchical data:
- Displays stream hierarchy with expand/collapse
- Shows ownership alignment badges
- Inline editing with dropdowns
- Real-time updates with cache invalidation

### Key Features
- **Dropdowns tied to database**: Options come from `org_unit` and `org_role` tables
- **Optimistic updates**: UI updates immediately, rollback on error
- **Smart caching**: Only invalidate affected queries

## 📈 Status Model

- **Aligned** ✅: Observed matches expected
- **Misattributed** ⚠️: Observed differs from expected  
- **Not Observed** ⭕: No ownership set yet

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router
- **UI**: Shadcn/ui + Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data**: TanStack Query + PostgreSQL
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety

## 🔑 Key Insights

### Why Trees Over Tables?
- Tables show flat data; trees show relationships
- Misattribution cascades are visible in hierarchy
- Natural place for rollup calculations
- Intuitive editing at the leaf level

### The Rosetta Stone Concept
Everything connects through atomic units:
- Each unit has ONE stream (work type)
- Each unit has ONE expected owner (by design)
- Each unit has ONE observed owner (reality)
- The gap reveals organizational fiction vs reality

### Data Principles
- **Append-only history**: Never UPDATE, always INSERT
- **Latest wins**: Views select most recent observation
- **Evidence everywhere**: Every change logged
- **Database-driven**: SQL views contain business logic

## **Pass/Fail (at a glance)**





**Fail (blocker).** The current UI violates the **View Contracts**, has **status logic contradictions** that corrupt summaries and filters, and the **edit flow** cannot persist valid observed ownership (wrong endpoint/payload). KPI/Finance/Evidence UIs are stubs, so key invariants are not surfaced. Details and precise fixes below.



------





## **How the implementation stacks up against the Ground‑Truth Invariants**







### **1) Ownership Truth Model (Expected vs Observed; append‑only; latest wins)**





- **Append‑only & latest‑wins are implemented in SQL**:

  

  - unit_observed_ownership is **insert‑only**; latest row is chosen via DISTINCT ON … ORDER BY observed_as_of DESC. This is used inside v_rosetta_truth.  

  

- **UI edit flow is broken** (cannot reliably persist):

  

  - StreamDetailView posts to /api/observed with **free‑text** role and org strings. There is **no** /api/observed route in the repo; the implemented endpoint is /api/observed-ownership and it expects **IDs** (accountable_role_id, accountable_org_unit_id) with allow‑listed/validated body. Result: edits won’t persist or will 400.  

  





**Verdict:** Data model is right; **UI write path is wrong** (critical).



------





### **2) Evidence Logging (every change; subject/type; actor; idempotency)**





- **POST /api/observed-ownership** **does log evidence** (subject = OBS_{obs_id}, type = ownership_update). Good. 
- **Actor not captured** on that write. evidence_log supports actor_person_id, actor_role_id, org_unit_id, and there’s an idempotency index option on (unit_id, subject_ref, evidence_type), but the API does **not** pass actor fields or accept an idempotency token. This misses the invariant (“actor, idempotency”).  





**Verdict:** **Partial**. Evidence rows exist, but missing **actor attribution** and **idempotency control** from the UI/API.



------





### **3) View Contracts (UI** 

### **must**

###  **read only views:** 

### **v_org_tree**

### **,** 

### **v_stream_tree**

### **,** 

### **v_rosetta_truth**

### **/**

### **v_misattribution_delta**

### **,** 

### **v_observed_from_evidence**

### **,** 

### **v_financial_rollup(_with_sga)**

### **)**





- The repo **claims** the UI reads only views. 

- **But implemented pages & APIs frequently hit raw tables**:

  

  - /stream/[code] page selects directly from atomic_unit, unit_expected_ownership, and LATERAL into unit_observed_ownership (raw tables). 
  - /streams page and its API query raw stream, atomic_unit, and unit_observed_ownership instead of v_stream_tree (and only optionally joins v_ownership_summary).  
  - GET /api/observed-ownership reads unit_observed_ownership directly for the latest record. **No view.** 
  - Truth page endpoint does call a **function** get_rosetta_truth_page (not a view); the function itself reads v_rosetta_truth. This is *close* but still not “views‑only”.  

  





**Verdict:** **Fail**. Multiple pages breach the “views‑only” contract.



------





### **4) Status Rules (Aligned / Misattributed / Not Observed)**





- **v_rosetta_truth emits only Aligned, Misattributed, Not Observed** (single “Misattributed”). 

- **UI & summary logic assume Role Mismatch and Org Mismatch**:

  

  - get_rosetta_truth_page maps the **Misattributed filter** to status IN ('Role Mismatch','Org Mismatch') — impossible with v_rosetta_truth → filter yields zero. 
  - v_ownership_summary counts misattributed_count as status IN ('Role Mismatch','Org Mismatch') while reading v_rosetta_truth. That will be **0** even when rows are “Misattributed”. 
  - The StatusBadge supports both “Misattributed” *and* “Role/Org Mismatch”, reflecting this inconsistency. 

  





**Verdict:** **Fail** (logic contradiction). Either change v_rosetta_truth to emit Role/Org breakdown *or* change UI + v_ownership_summary to treat “Misattributed” as a single state.



------





### **5) Truth Row Fallback (fallback to** 

### **v_misattribution_delta**

###  **if** 

### **v_rosetta_truth**

###  **missing)**





- No fallback observed in the API or component code; all pagination/summary paths assume v_rosetta_truth exists.  
- v_misattribution_delta **does** produce the finer states (Role/Org mismatch) — but the UI isn’t using it. 





**Verdict:** **Fail** (unimplemented fallback).



------





### **6) KPI Aggregations (SUM, RATIO_OF_SUMS, WEIGHTED_AVG — clear & traceable)**





- The **views** exist to support KPI/outcome rollups (v_stream_rollup, v_kpi_rollup) but the **UI pages are stubs** (/kpis Coming Soon). No surface for SUM/RATIO_OF_SUMS/WEIGHTED_AVG with traceability.  





**Verdict:** **Missing** (functional gap).



------





### **7) Security Guardrails (allow‑list, validated inputs)**





- **Good**: /api/observed-ownership uses Zod schema + explicit allowlist + FK validation, and logs evidence. 
- **But**: the *client* edit path (Stream page) isn’t wired to this route nor to IDs, so validations never trigger; also other modifying routes (e.g., KPI, Evidence) are not implemented yet.  





**Verdict:** **Partial**. Server guardrail OK where implemented; client wiring missing.



------





## **Critical Bugs (blockers)**





1. **Status mismatch corrupts filters and summaries**

   

   - get_rosetta_truth_page treats “Misattributed” as (Role Mismatch,Org Mismatch) while v_rosetta_truth only emits “Misattributed” (single). This will make the “Misattributed” filter show **no rows** and set **misattributed_count to 0** in summaries.

     Fix: either (A) change status logic everywhere to “Misattributed” (single), or (B) swap to v_misattribution_delta (rename attribution_status → status) and keep Role/Org detail.   

   

2. **Edit flow is pointed at the wrong endpoint with wrong payload**

   

   - Client posts to /api/observed with string values, but only /api/observed-ownership exists and expects **IDs**. Evidence: StreamDetailView vs API route.

     Fix: use dropdowns (sourced from v_role_options, v_org_options) that submit accountable_role_id/accountable_org_unit_id to /api/observed-ownership.   

   

3. **View Contract violation** (reads raw tables)

   

   - /stream/[code], /streams, and GET /api/observed-ownership hit raw tables instead of the published views. This undermines stability and “latest wins” guarantees.   

   

4. **No fallback to v_misattribution_delta**

   

   - If v_rosetta_truth changes or fails, the truth page dies. Add fallback to keep UI robust as schema evolves.  

   





------





## **Functional Gaps**





- **Evidence UI** (proof browsing & filters) is a placeholder; not consuming v_observed_from_evidence.  
- **KPI UI** (targets, measurements, cascade & rollups) is a placeholder; no surfacing of SUM/RATIO_OF_SUMS/WEIGHTED_AVG semantics. 
- **Finance UI** is a placeholder; not consuming v_financial_rollup/v_financial_rollup_with_sga. 
- **Ownership option dropdowns** for edits are missing; typing raw strings leads to invalid writes. (Use v_role_options, v_org_options.) 





------





## **Schema / UI Misalignments**





- **Status taxonomy**:

  

  - v_rosetta_truth → Misattributed (single).
  - v_misattribution_delta → Role Mismatch / Org Mismatch / Not Observed / Aligned.
  - UI & v_ownership_summary assume the **delta taxonomy** while sourcing v_rosetta_truth. **Pick one taxonomy and align all consumers.**   

  

- **Observed edit payload**: UI sends strings; API expects numeric FKs. Use the helper views for dropdowns to submit IDs.   





------





## **Design Flaws (beauty, clarity, proof)**





- **Proof of attribution not visible** on Truth screen (no side‑panel or drill to v_observed_from_evidence). You say “Evidence everywhere”, but the UI page is coming soon — no way to *show* the receipts inline.  
- **Navigation promises** (Org/KPIs/Finance/Evidence) lead to “Coming Soon” cards — elegant visually, but they conceal required invariants (KPI math, finance rollups, proof browsing). 
- **Streams page metrics** use raw joins and “ownership coverage” logic that indicates *existence* of any observation, not the “latest wins” truth via views. This erodes conceptual clarity. 





------





## **Recommendations (where to fix: UI, DB, or both)**







### **A. Normalize the status model (**

### **DB + UI**

### **)**





Option 1 — **Single status** in truth:



- Keep v_rosetta_truth returning **Aligned / Misattributed / Not Observed**.
- Change get_rosetta_truth_page filter and v_ownership_summary to count/filter **status = 'Misattributed'** (not Role/Org).  





Option 2 — **Richer status** everywhere:



- Switch Truth table to source from **v_misattribution_delta** (rename attribution_status → status) so you can display Role Mismatch vs Org Mismatch. Update get_rosetta_truth_page and v_ownership_summary accordingly. 





> Pick one, apply across API, SQL helpers, StatusBadge, and summaries. Don’t mix.





### **B. Fix the edit flow (**

### **UI**

### **)**





- Replace free‑text inputs with **dropdowns** bound to v_role_options and v_org_options, and post to /api/observed-ownership with **IDs**. Add optimistic update, then refresh the single truth row or page.  
- Add **actor capture** to the evidence log (single‑user → hardcode actor for now, but keep the fields). Allow an optional **idempotency key** (subject_ref) in the POST body and use the ux_evidence_natural uniqueness to dedupe. 







### **C. Honor the views‑only contract (**

### **UI**

### **)**





- Refactor reads to **views only**:

  

  - Streams: switch to v_stream_tree or a stream summary view; enrich with v_ownership_summary.

  - Stream detail: use v_rosetta_truth (or v_misattribution_delta if adopting Option 2) filtered by stream_code.

  - Observed GET: introduce a v_latest_observed (or rely on truth view fields) instead of hitting the base table.

    Evidence page should use v_observed_from_evidence.  

  







### **D. Implement truth fallback (**

### **UI**

### **)**





- In /api/truth/paginated, **try** get_rosetta_truth_page first; if it errors (view absent), **fallback** to a get_misattribution_delta_page function or a simple select from v_misattribution_delta with compatible columns.  







### **E. Surface KPI math & finance (**

### **UI**

### **)**





- Build /kpis to show, per KPI, the aggregation type (**SUM / RATIO_OF_SUMS / WEIGHTED_AVG**) and the exact rollup path; include “show SQL” or “explain card” for traceability.
- Build /finance to toggle **direct vs allocated** using v_financial_rollup vs v_financial_rollup_with_sga.  





------





## **Usability Gaps (quick hits)**





- **Seeded data not fully editable** due to the broken observed edit path. (Fix B.) 
- **Ownership rules not self‑explaining**: add a help popover in Truth clarifying the status taxonomy you standardize on (“how is ‘Misattributed’ computed?”).
- **Rollups hidden**: show the Ownership Summary card above the Truth grid (already present) and link counts to pre‑filtered views (e.g., click “Misattributed 7” → opens table filter). (Partially present; verify after status fix.)





------





## **Final Judgment**





- **Critical Bugs:** Status contradictions; broken edit endpoint/payload; views‑only contract violations; missing truth fallback. (Blockers.)
- **Functional Gaps:** Evidence/KPI/Finance UIs not implemented; no KPI aggregation transparency.
- **Schema/UI Misalignments:** Status taxonomy; edit payload types.
- **Design Flaws:** Proof not visible on Truth; nav leads to stubs for invariants‑critical areas.





**Conclusion: Fail** — Do **not** proceed until the above are addressed. The fastest path to green:



1. **Unify status model** (DB+UI) and fix get_rosetta_truth_page/v_ownership_summary.   
2. **Fix edit flow** to /api/observed-ownership with **ID dropdowns** (role/org). Capture **actor** in evidence.   
3. **Refactor reads to views only** across Streams/Detail/Observed GET. Add **truth fallback** to v_misattribution_delta.   
4. **Ship minimal Evidence view** against v_observed_from_evidence; **then** bring KPI & Finance out of “Coming Soon” using existing views.

# UI Implementation Specification v4.0

*Production-ready with performance optimizations and complete error handling*

## 1. System Architecture

### Technology Stack

```yaml
Frontend:
  - Next.js 14.2.5 (App Router)
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Shadcn/ui components
  - React Query for data fetching
  - Virtual scrolling for large datasets
  
Backend:
  - PostgreSQL (local)
  - Node.js API routes
  - pg driver with connection pooling
  - Transaction support for multi-table operations

Key Patterns:
  - Append-only writes for ownership
  - Optimistic UI updates with rollback
  - Server-side pagination with client-side caching
  - Single user (no auth)
  - Evidence logging for all meaningful changes
  - Foreign key validation on all writes
```

### Database Views Contract (VERIFIED)

```typescript
// Core views that exist and are tested
interface DatabaseViews {
  // Core Rosetta views
  'v_rosetta_stone_enhanced': RosettaEnhancedRow;
  'v_rosetta_truth': RosettaTruthRow;
  'v_misattribution_delta': MisattributionRow;
  
  // Tree navigation
  'v_org_tree': OrgTreeNode;
  'v_stream_tree': StreamTreeNode;
  
  // Financial views  
  'v_financial_rollup': FinancialRow;
  'v_financial_rollup_with_sga': FinancialWithSGARow;
  
  // Evidence and KPIs
  'v_observed_from_evidence': EvidenceRow;
  'v_stream_rollup': StreamOutcomeRow;
  'v_kpi_rollup': KPIRollupRow;
  
  // UI Helper views (NEW in 10-ui-helpers.sql)
  'v_role_options': DropdownOption;
  'v_org_options': HierarchicalOption;
  'v_stream_options': StreamOption;
  'v_ownership_summary': OwnershipSummary;
  
  // Pagination function
  'get_rosetta_truth_page': PaginatedTruthFunction;
}
```

## 2. Page Specifications

### `/truth` - Ownership Truth Table (WITH PAGINATION)

#### Data Sources

```typescript
// Paginated data fetching
async function getTruthData(
  page: number = 1,
  pageSize: number = 50,
  filters?: {
    stream?: string;
    status?: string;
  }
) {
  const offset = (page - 1) * pageSize;
  
  const result = await sql`
    SELECT * FROM get_rosetta_truth_page(
      ${pageSize}::int,
      ${offset}::int,
      ${filters?.stream}::text,
      ${filters?.status}::text
    )`;
  
  return {
    data: result.rows,
    totalCount: result.rows[0]?.total_count || 0,
    pageCount: Math.ceil((result.rows[0]?.total_count || 0) / pageSize)
  };
}

// Summary statistics
async function getOwnershipSummary() {
  return sql`SELECT * FROM v_ownership_summary ORDER BY stream`;
}
```

#### Interactions with Validation

```typescript
// Ownership update with transaction and validation
async function updateOwnership(
  unitId: number,
  field: 'role' | 'org',
  value: number | null
) {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');
    
    // 1. Validate foreign key if not null
    if (value !== null) {
      const table = field === 'role' ? 'org_role' : 'org_unit';
      const column = field === 'role' ? 'role_id' : 'org_unit_id';
      
      const exists = await client.query(
        `SELECT 1 FROM ${table} WHERE ${column} = $1`,
        [value]
      );
      
      if (exists.rowCount === 0) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid ${field} ID: ${value}`);
      }
    }
    
    // 2. Append to observed ownership
    const columnName = field === 'role' 
      ? 'accountable_role_id' 
      : 'accountable_org_unit_id';
    
    await client.query(
      `INSERT INTO unit_observed_ownership (
        unit_id, observed_as_of, ${columnName}, source, confidence_pct, notes
      ) VALUES ($1, NOW(), $2, 'UI', 1.0, $3)`,
      [unitId, value, `Updated ${field} via Truth page`]
    );
    
    // 3. Log evidence
    await client.query(
      `INSERT INTO evidence_log (
        unit_id, subject_ref, evidence_type, system_ref, occurred_at, notes
      ) VALUES ($1, $2, 'ownership_update', 'UI', NOW(), $3)`,
      [unitId, `OWNERSHIP_${Date.now()}`, `Changed ${field} to ${value}`]
    );
    
    await client.query('COMMIT');
    return { success: true };
    
  } catch (error) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw error;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

#### NULL Handling

```tsx
// Component handles missing roles/orgs gracefully
function OwnershipCell({ 
  value, 
  expected,
  type,
  onUpdate 
}: OwnershipCellProps) {
  const options = useQuery(
    ['options', type],
    () => fetch(`/api/options/${type}`).then(r => r.json())
  );
  
  // Handle UNDEFINED expected ownership
  if (expected === 'UNDEFINED') {
    return (
      <div className="text-muted-foreground italic">
        Not defined in system
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  // Handle NOT_SET observed ownership
  if (value === 'NOT_SET') {
    return (
      <InlineEdit
        value={null}
        options={options.data || []}
        placeholder="Click to set"
        onSave={onUpdate}
      />
    );
  }
  
  return (
    <InlineEdit
      value={value}
      options={options.data || []}
      onSave={onUpdate}
    />
  );
}
```

### `/streams` - Value Stream Navigator (INCLUDES EXPAND)

#### Data Sources

```sql
-- All 6 streams including EXPAND
SELECT * FROM v_stream_tree 
WHERE parent_id IS NULL
ORDER BY order_in_parent;

-- Stream-specific units
SELECT * FROM v_rosetta_stone_enhanced
WHERE stream_code = ${streamCode}
ORDER BY order_in_stream;
```

#### Stream Cards

```tsx
function StreamGrid() {
  const streams = [
    { code: 'WIN', name: 'Win Work', icon: Trophy },
    { code: 'DELIVER', name: 'Deliver Work', icon: Package },
    { code: 'COLLECT', name: 'Collect Cash', icon: DollarSign },

    { code: 'OPERATE', name: 'Operate Business', icon: Settings }
  ];
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
      {streams.map(stream => (
        <StreamCard key={stream.code} {...stream} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `/org` - Organization Hierarchy

#### Dropdown Population

```typescript
// Use new helper views for dropdowns
async function getOrgOptions() {
  const result = await sql`
    SELECT * FROM v_org_options 
    ORDER BY depth, path`;
  
  return result.rows.map(row => ({
    value: row.value,
    label: row.label,
    depth: row.depth,
    code: row.code
  }));
}

async function getRoleOptions() {
  const result = await sql`
    SELECT * FROM v_role_options`;
  
  return result.rows.map(row => ({
    value: row.value,
    label: row.label,
    code: row.code
  }));
}
```

### `/evidence` - Evidence Log with Types

#### Constrained Evidence Types

```typescript
// Evidence types are now constrained in database
type EvidenceType = 
  | 'ownership_update'
  | 'kpi_measurement'
  | 'pricing_decision'
  | 'solution_outline'
  | 'proposal_redline'
  | 'recruit_req'
  | 'scope_change'
  | 'milestone_complete'
  | 'invoice_adjustment';

interface EvidenceFilters {
  unit?: string;
  type?: EvidenceType;
  dateRange?: { from: Date; to: Date };
  actor?: string;
  stream?: string; // NEW: filter by stream
}
```

### `/kpis` - KPI Management

#### Batch Updates with Transaction

```typescript
async function updateKPITargets(
  updates: Array<{
    kpiId: number;
    unitId?: number;
    target: number;
    yellowThreshold: number;

        [update.kpiId]
      );
      
      if (kpiExists.rowCount === 0) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid KPI ID: ${update.kpiId}`);
      }
      
      // Update or insert target
      await client.query(`
        INSERT INTO kpi_target (

  } catch (error) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw error;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}
```

## 3. Component Library Updates

### Pagination Component

```typescript
// components/DataTablePagination.tsx
export function DataTablePagination({
  pageCount,
  currentPage,
  onPageChange,
  pageSize,
  totalCount
}: PaginationProps) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between px-2 py-4">

        >
          Last
        </Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Summary Dashboard Component

```typescript
// components/OwnershipSummary.tsx
export function OwnershipSummary() {
  const { data } = useQuery(['ownership-summary'], 
    () => fetch('/api/summary/ownership').then(r => r.json())
  );
  
  if (!data) return <Skeleton className="h-32" />;
  
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-6 gap-4">
      {data.map((stream: any) => (
        <Card key={stream.stream}>
          <CardHeader className="pb-2">
            <CardTitle className="text-sm">{stream.stream_name}</CardTitle>

## 4. API Endpoints with Validation

### Enhanced API Security

```typescript
// api/observed-ownership/route.ts

      { status: 500 }
    );
    
  } finally {
    client.release();

}
```

## 5. Database Setup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup-database.sh

echo "Setting up Rosetta Console database..."

# Run migrations in order
for script in elire_ops_1/*.sql; do
  echo "Running $script..."
  psql -d $DATABASE_URL -f $script
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "Error running $script"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "Running UI helpers..."
psql -d $DATABASE_URL -f elire_ops_1/10-ui-helpers.sql

echo "Validating setup..."
psql -d $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM v_ui_validation;"

echo "Database setup complete!"
```

## 6. Performance Optimizations

### Virtual Scrolling for Large Lists

```typescript
// Use @tanstack/react-virtual for large datasets
import { useVirtualizer } from '@tanstack/react-virtual';

function VirtualizedUnitList({ units }: { units: any[] }) {
  const parentRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  
  const virtualizer = useVirtualizer({
    count: units.length,
    getScrollElement: () => parentRef.current,
    estimateSize: () => 60,
    overscan: 10
  });
  
  return (
    <div ref={parentRef} className="h-[600px] overflow-auto">
      <div
        style={{
          height: `${virtualizer.getTotalSize()}px`,
          width: '100%',
          position: 'relative',
        }}
      >
        {virtualizer.getVirtualItems().map((virtualItem) => (
          <div
            key={virtualItem.key}
            style={{
              position: 'absolute',
              top: 0,
              left: 0,
              width: '100%',
              height: `${virtualItem.size}px`,

          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Query Caching Strategy

```typescript
// lib/queryClient.ts
import { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';

export const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      // Cache for 5 minutes
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000,
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000,
      
      // Retry failed requests
      retry: (failureCount, error: any) => {
        if (error?.status === 404) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      },
      
      // Background refetch
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      refetchOnReconnect: 'always'
    }
  }
});
```

## 8. Error Handling Patterns

### Database Connection Errors

```typescript
// lib/db.ts
class DatabaseError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code?: string,
    public detail?: string
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'DatabaseError';
  }
}

export async function withRetry<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries = 3
): Promise<T> {
  let lastError: any;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error: any) {
      lastError = error;
      
      // Don't retry on validation errors
      if (error.code === '23503' || error.code === '23502') {
        throw new DatabaseError(
          'Validation error',
          error.code,
          error.detail
        );
      }
      
      // Exponential backoff for connection errors
      if (error.code === 'ECONNREFUSED' || error.code === 'ETIMEDOUT') {
        await new Promise(resolve => 
          setTimeout(resolve, Math.pow(2, i) * 1000)
        );
        continue;
      }
      
      throw error;
    }
  }
  
  throw lastError;
}
```

### UI Error Boundaries

```typescript
// components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
export class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component<
  { children: React.ReactNode },
  { hasError: boolean; error?: Error }
> {
  constructor(props: any) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error) {
    return { hasError: true, error };
  }
  
  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {
    console.error('Error boundary caught:', error, errorInfo);
    
    // Send to error tracking service
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      // Track error
    }
  }
  
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      return (
        <Alert variant="destructive">
          <AlertTitle>Something went wrong</AlertTitle>
          <AlertDescription>
            {this.state.error?.message || 'An unexpected error occurred'}
          </AlertDescription>
          <Button
            onClick={() => window.location.reload()}
            className="mt-4"
          >
            Reload Page
          </Button>
        </Alert>
      );
    }
    
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
```

## 9. Testing Utilities

### Database Test Helpers

```typescript
// test/db-helpers.ts
export async function seedTestData() {
  const client = await pool.connect();
  
  try {
    await client.query('BEGIN');
    
    // Clear existing test data
    await client.query(`
      DELETE FROM unit_observed_ownership 
      WHERE source = 'TEST'
    `);
    
    // Add test observations
    const units = await client.query(
      'SELECT unit_id FROM atomic_unit LIMIT 5'
    );
    
    for (const unit of units.rows) {
      await client.query(`
        INSERT INTO unit_observed_ownership
        (unit_id, observed_as_of, accountable_role_id, source)
        VALUES ($1, NOW(), 
          (SELECT role_id FROM org_role LIMIT 1),
          'TEST')
      `, [unit.unit_id]);
    }
    
    await client.query('COMMIT');
    
  } catch (error) {
    await client.query('ROLLBACK');
    throw error;
  } finally {
    client.release();
  }
}

export async function cleanupTestData() {
  await sql`
    DELETE FROM unit_observed_ownership 
    WHERE source = 'TEST'
  `;
  
  await sql`
    DELETE FROM evidence_log 
    WHERE system_ref = 'TEST'
  `;
}
```

# UI Narrative Goals

## The Story We're Telling Through Software

### The Problem Made Visible

Every professional services firm believes they understand their business through org charts, P&Ls, and utilization reports. But these are comfortable fictions. The truth lives in the gap between who should do work and who actually does it—and that gap is killing margins while burning out the people who actually deliver value.

### What This UI Must Accomplish

#### 1. **Expose the Hidden Organization**

The real organization isn't the org chart. It's the network of who actually makes decisions, who carries the burden, and where value is created. This UI makes that network visible for the first time.

Every atomic unit of work becomes a lens. Through it, you can see:

- The official owner (the fiction we maintain)
- The actual owner (the exhausted hero doing the work)
- The cost of that gap (in hours, dollars, and human suffering)

#### 2. **Quantify the Burden**

"COEs are overwhelmed" is an opinion. "Cloud Enterprise COE carries 347 hours/month of sales work worth $52,000 in unbillable time" is a fact that demands action.

The UI must make burden tangible:

- Hours of work being done by the wrong people
- Dollar value of that misallocated effort
- Percentage of capacity consumed by others' responsibilities

#### 3. **Connect Decisions to Outcomes**

That 10% discount doesn't just reduce revenue—it cascades through resource decisions, scope compromises, and quality tradeoffs. The UI must show these connections in real-time.

When someone asks "Can we discount?", the UI shows:

- Who's actually making that decision (rarely who should)
- What margins become after the discount
- Which downstream compromises become necessary
- The cycle time impact of the decision process itself

#### 4. **Make AI Readiness Tangible**

"We need to be AI-ready" is abstract. "This unit scores 30% on AI readiness because ownership is undefined, evidence lives in email, and KPIs aren't measured" is actionable.

For each unit of work, show:

- Can AI enhance this today? (Usually no)
- What's blocking AI from helping? (Specific gaps)
- What's the opportunity cost? (Competitors gaining 40% efficiency here)

### The User Journey

#### Day 1: Recognition

A COE lead opens the Rosetta page for "WIN-03 Pricing Decision". They see themselves as the observed owner when Sales should own it. They see 72-hour cycle times when the target is 24. They see their team spending 47 hours/month on this. The problem is no longer abstract.

#### Week 1: Revelation

As more observed ownership is captured, patterns emerge. The Insights dashboard shows that Service Execution carries 40% of Client Relationships' work. That Finance provides data 6 weeks late. That Talent doesn't actually plan workforce needs. The organizational fiction collapses, replaced by operational truth.

#### Month 1: Redistribution

Armed with evidence, leaders can finally have real conversations. Not "Sales should own pricing" but "Sales owning pricing would save COEs 347 hours/month and reduce cycle time by 48 hours, improving win rate by 7%." Ownership starts shifting to where it belongs.

#### Quarter 1: Results

With clear ownership, defined work, and visible KPIs:

- Cycle times drop (24-hour pricing decisions)
- Margins improve (scope capture increases)
- Burnout decreases (people do their actual jobs)
- AI enhancement becomes possible (defined, owned, measured work)

### Design Principles

#### 1. **Truth Over Comfort**

Never hide uncomfortable realities. If COEs are drowning, show it in red. If margins are negative, make them blink. Comfort preserves dysfunction.

#### 2. **Evidence Over Opinion**

Every claim must be traceable to evidence. Not "Sales doesn't do discovery" but "17 of 20 solution outlines last month were created by COE leads (evidence: PSA timesheets)."

#### 3. **Impact Over Activity**

Don't show that misattribution exists—show what it costs. Don't show KPIs are missed—show the revenue impact. Make every metric tie to money or time.

#### 4. **Clarity Over Completeness**

Better to show 5 critical things clearly than 50 things poorly. Each page should answer one question completely rather than many questions partially.

### Success Metrics for the UI

1. **Adoption**: Are people recording observed ownership weekly?
2. **Accuracy**: Does observed ownership match evidence from systems?
3. **Action**: Are ownership patterns changing based on insights?
4. **Acceleration**: Are cycle times decreasing?
5. **AI Readiness**: Are units becoming more AI-enhanceable?

### The Ultimate Test

In 90 days, when someone asks "Can we discount 10%?", the UI should provide:

- Who should make this decision (Sales)
- Who will actually make it (COE lead)
- How long it will take (72 hours currently, 24 hour target)
- What it will cost in margin (5% becomes -2%)
- What compromises it requires (offshore resources, compressed timeline)
- Whether AI could help (not until ownership is clear)

If the UI can answer that question completely in under 60 seconds, we've succeeded.

### The Transformation

This isn't just a database UI. It's an organizational CAT scan that shows where the cancer of misattribution is killing the business. It's a blueprint for redistributing work to where it belongs. It's a readiness assessment for an AI-augmented future.

Most importantly, it's a path from heroic suffering to systematic success. From undefined chaos to enhanced clarity. From working harder to working smarter.

The UI doesn't just display data—it drives transformation by making the invisible visible, the intangible tangible, and the impossible inevitable.

# SWOT

###### S U M M A RY

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Strengths

- Company culture (team motivation and success, committed to clients’ success, collaboration working across areas, passion about being trusted advisor, access to leadership,
  etc.) that is nurtured through multiple channels

  offerings but also helps create a niche on PSFT to Cloud
- Proprietary methodology and accelerator tools that can serve as true differentiators
- Mature service offerings and methodologies for application roadmap, optimization, and business process improvement combined with in-depth knowledge of our clients'
  different systems allows us to tailor solutions and more fully service our clients ‘needs (People, Process, Technology) in a nimble way
- Ability to use both an onshore presence and a nearshore/offshore presence, as required
- Committed and long-term customers, strategic relationships, Practice lead Rolodex and client touch
- Ability to respond to customer needs – nimble: adjust offerings, components of deal
- Ability to complete internal projects to continuously improve Elire based upon the guide of the Annual Survey, the external Board, the Professional Services Maturity Model
- Dedicated PMO, data visualization, process experts
- Marketing content compared to peers
- Increasingly strong internal Financial controls and accountability
- Best in class systems have been implemented across all major areas
- Competitive benefits: Unlimited PTO, commissions, hybrid work model, bonuses
- Cloud based SaaS for internal IT with excellent customer support

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Weaknesses

- Consistency of tools/methodologies usage across practice areas and the use of the best-in-class systems we implemented to help areas run more effectively
- Challenging resource mixes and types that require higher pricing in many instances and don’t create the correct internal incentives to achieve a more ideal Consulting Pyramid
- Federal Government Challenges – endanger of retaining "small business" classification, lack of Federal Contracts (GSA, IP4,etc), knowledge of how Federal Govt Contracts & Projects executed, not a MWBE
- Inexperienced teams, resources past their prime, need to retool resource mix
- Underexperienced managers able to develop authentic relationships where able to provide opportunities to Lead, Learn and Feel Proud in a Psychologically Safe environment and successfully manage
  capability gaps (skill profiles), motivation gap (desire profiles), and license gaps (agency profiles). Ultimately, drive firm growth, reduce attrition, grow the next generation of leaders
- Inconsistent maintenance of internal application instances necessary to support sales and customer demos often supporting new business opportunities
- Underdeveloped Success Stories that lack easy to tell realized benefits stories tailored to client P&L owners and that highlight true Elire differentiators, often rely on same 5-10, must communicate value
- Underdeveloped offerings and marketing for change management, data analytics, training, and testing that limit the ability to present more fully realized transformational solutions to our clients
  (perception that application oriented only)
- Underdeveloped sales strategy that lacks consistency/robustness and inhibits cross COE selling – focused on siloed solutions rather than comprehensive client transformation, Lead gen (outside of personal
  relationships) – hyper focus on events vs. continuous campaigning, nurturing
- Immature and inconsistent training and development of resources - Growth, development and learning, certifications, soft skills. New hire onboarding/training process
- Limited Strategic Partners – Need to expand and deepen our relationships with oracle representatives which allows us to service new areas.
- Reliance on delivery team for all things oracle cloud... need more knowledge in Solution Center
- Experience in emerging tech, e.g., AI, blockchain
- Sales / marketing / recruiting / delivery prioritization coordination and alignment, accountability to critical tasks assigned by Pillars
- Not enough competitor analysis or analysis of market needs that are driving/impacting key industries or functions (CFO, CHRO) and therefore a lack of ability for Elire to properly respond
- Lack of depth for Recruiting , lack of visibility into skills needed to be successful on projects, lessening of nurturing of the Friends of Elire network
- Need to better utilize PSA / ERP dashboards, reporting, and other capabilities
- Small IT staff, lack of overall employee awareness for importance of IT security, End users’ devices/software not centrally managed

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Opportunities

- Growing markets: Fed gov’t, Higher Ed, Healthcare
- Advancement in procure to pay space and also AP automation
- Companies need for future state application and roadmap (Oracle), migration to Cloud
- Partnership opportunities, e.g. Oracle, AP providers, new verticals, etc.
- Vacancy of larger integrators from the PS market
- Heavy client investment in space despite mature market
- New and emerging tech - Oracle is continuing to pour billions of R&D money into their cloud platforms, analytics, and even PSFT
- Emerging customer needs (meet via targeted service offerings)
- Oracle Guided Learning market
- Customer resources supporting PeopleSoft are beginning to retire and/or migrate over to various other technologies opening the door for additional consulting support
  opportunities and opening the door for lesser experienced consultants to be accepted and successful on projects
- Changes in ERP create need for Success Hub solutions, complement other Elire offerings
- Wellness programs are becoming larger trend in workforce
- Changing talent / work force dynamics: ability to source due to remote work, etc
- Changing and improving expectations and technologies that would allow larger volumes to more easily move through an expanded Talent candidate funnel (AI interview
  applications, testing, and video)
- Shifting trends towards willingness to have a Technology / Administration / Data Security fee to client SOWs

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Threats

- Market saturation, entering/expanding into crowded markets (e.g., Success Hub, Data analytics, Success Hubs, etc.), pricing pressure that threatens to commoditize services
- Niche competitors and lower cost service providers penetrate market
- Scarcity of key skills in the market, how to get Managed service consultants to go into MS when standard delivery is remote, drive toward projects in the Fed space require
  more harder to find US Citizens
- Larger complex projects in complex markets and industries bring inherent risks and threats
- Economic turmoil and inflation, rising costs of health care, etc
- Lower corporate investment budgets
- Emerging tech
- Oracle as only driver of market potential, Oracle strategy changes, changing personnel, changing focus
- Oracle changing reps drive loss of relationships
- Dynamic ERP drives havoc on maintenance
- Changing requirements for certifications
- Employee expectations for comp. increasing, Gen Z expectations, remote workforce trends
- Remote work culture threatening the “roll my chair” over culture that consulting depends upon to mentor, nurture employees
- Increased complexity in state taxation, registration, and reporting (where did you do the work)
- Increasingly sophisticated hacking and phishing attacks

## Pre-work

- What strengths are most critical to preserve?
- What weaknesses are most critical to resolve?
- What external factors must be acted upon (opportunities and threats)?

- Biggest Comp adv (PS) for Elire is low on market
  attractiveness
- Opportunity in Cloud ERP because of market
  attractiveness
- 1 - 2 Big Dots and the rest are relatively small
- Strengths in PS, Cloud HCM, and Treasury.
  Weakness in standalone sales for supporting
  practices of TRAS, SAS, Nearshore, MS, Cloud
  ERP, PMO
- Important to have all of these capabilities to
  support our key areas, but not as important to
  market all of them as standalone services.
- This aligns with our SWOT analysis on what
  practice areas are tough to sell, low on revenue,
  low on market demand.

## Utilization and Margin Analysis – 2022

```
Key implications and insights
```

- Strategic Advisory Services and TRAS are
  two areas with the highest Gross Profit
  Margin with SAS at a 79% utilization rate;
  TRAS is lower at only 44%. Both Practices
  combined are only 8% of revenue
- PeopleSoft makes up the highest
  percentage of revenue (38%) and is the
  utilized the highest (94%) but is tied with
  Kyriba, and Solution Center COE with the
  lowest GPM (27%)
- Cloud ERP, Cloud HCM, PS Treasury and
  PeopleSoft all have > 80% utilization but are
  all under 35% GPM

- The Gross Profit Margin dropped overall from 2021 to 2022 in nearly all Practices, mainly due to wage increases without an
  increased bill rate to support the cost.
- Utilization picked up and we became more efficient but increasing employee & sub costs eroded any efficiency gains we may
  have gained from the utilization pickup.

Key Insights
```

- HCM has solid quals for full suite implementations, but we haven’t
  had a go-live since Jan 2020. We need go-lives to get certifications
  so that we are a qualified implementation partner
- ERP has its first full suite implementation going on now with CGS –
  this is a critical qual for us to get more work
- Market is very large and we’re very immature in processes and
  expertise – HCM has found its success with large full suite
  implementations, ERP has found its success with optimization
  work
- We outsource EPM now, would like to bring that in house via
  acquisition or developing internal expertise
- Our COE is already in 3 large areas where we don’t have a name
  enough to break out into a new SaaS offering (Oracle HCM, ERP,
  EPM cloud). For the next 3 years, we need to focus solely on
  Oracle Cloud
- One of our top competitive advantages is having PeopleSoft and
  Cloud expertise in our firm – we are one of the only firms with as
  deep of a PeopleSoft practice that also has a cloud practice
- Need to mature and grow our core competency areas – Base
  installations of Cloud HCM and ERP and develop optimization and
  Day 2 differentiators

## Unique and Important

**Core Implementation (day 1 services)** – getting clients live with base system: Every
consulting firm has a methodology
**EBS or other systems to cloud** – We don’t understand EBS or other on prem
applications, but we do need to convert organizations from these systems. We don’t
have the same compelling PeopleSoft to cloud story, but we’ve had success with
migrating customers from other systems. The approach is slightly different, but we
need to be at par with other organizations that move clients from these systems,
especially EBS
**Doing managed services** – we need to be able to at least be on par doing managed
services for our clients

```
PeopleSoft to Cloud – Elire is one of the only firms in the market with deep PeopleSoft experience that
also has a cloud practice. We’ve had almost all of our HCM success because of existing PeopleSoft
clients. We have tools to help clients move to cloud and need to continue developing these tools and
build marketing around it
Transformational approach to implementation: from how we consult during RFP process, to P0 – how
we introduce the software, to how we help them unlock the potential of the software
Trusted Advisor: Our best clients are clients that view us as their trusted advisor. They know if they pick
up the phone and call practice lead or partner, they will get the answer resolved – it’s a white glove
service. But to be our clients true trusted advisor, we need to understand their industry and the
problems they face and develop trust because we have a methodology that can deliver results. Our
methodology needs work on relationships more, and we need to elevate the level of expertise in our
consulting base
Day 0 Services : Helping our clients on their cloud journey while they’re still on prem (especially
peoplesoft clients) – Aspirational – need to do a better job partnering with MAS and OnPrem to be
successful here
Day 2 services: We don’t have this yet, but we’re seeing this as a very large opportunity. When we have
a niche skill set area for an emerging tech, we can do a marketing campaign and get new opportunities
which lead to add on work. We aspire to be though leaders in unlocking the potential of the cloud to
give customers the vision of what oracle sees the software being
```

**Low percentage wins** : Going after projects where we don’t have an advantage (oracle
backs us, existing relationship, compelling story because of industry knowledge, etc).
We’ve spent a lot of times on RFPs with low percentage wins. Often, we’re trying to
take what we can get, and if we do win, we create a new potential market.

```
Federal Market Expertise – huge opportunity but we do not yet have the knowledge needed – actively
working on building out
ELIRE INC. 2022ELIRE INC. 2022
```

## Growth Opportunities

```
EPM – we currently outsource all opportunities
Federal Cloud – most still on PeopleSoft HR, good oracle alignment
Oracle Integration Cloud – Important tool for cloud transformations, limited in house expertise
ElireConversion Toolkit – helps our story of PeopleSoft to Cloud
OCI, AWS, Azure/Cloud infrastructure – Not a market we currently address. could be huge for PS
clients that don’t want to move to fusion or to more fully assist clients on cloud journey
DevOps - Might align more with Managed Services, but this is a skill set we don’t have, but growing
market
VBCS, APEX – Aligns with oracle’s strategy of cloud personalization
Tribes – new market that aligns with oracle objectives and our strongest oracle cloud relationships,
most still on legacy erpsand just starting transitions to cloud
State/Local – huge market that we haven’t had a lot of success in Cloud yet, but do have cloud
resources with a lot of experience
Oracle Cloud SCM – Cloud suite that we have limited experience with, but have an
internal resource with a lot of experience. SCM is very early in adoption and maturity
AI – Huge oracle investment, ultimate goal of the cloud strategy, still immature
Digital Assistant – large oracle investment, gaining traction, still immature, have some
internal expertise and one client that piloted (US Navy) and an external resource that is
very skilled
AP IDR – Oracle’s new AP imaging technology –will be bundled into the application and
large oracle investment. Plays into our MAS expertise in this area
BankBridge – Cloud ERP clients that want a bank integration solution
Rev Rec, Lease Accounting – success in on prem, could have large implications in cloud
Joint Ventures (setup in cloud) – we have experience because of CGS and see this as a
growth area for complex government contracting companies
RPA – MAS has done some work here, has potential in cloud
SCM – We have unique existing skillset in Cloud ERP practice and potential clients from
these resources
Oracle Cloud ERP (financials) – this is our core ERP practice competency –we’re still very early in
growth (both Elireand Oracle) and there is a lot of opportunity as customers transition to cloud
Oracle Cloud HCM – We have quals and experience, market is maturing, need to continue building our
internal competencies
PeopleSoft customers – One of our core differentiators is moving PeopleSoft to cloud –any PeopleSoft
customer should be a target
Existing PeopleSoft clients – our existing PeopleSoft client base is our best source of new cloud
customers. We’ve had success here and need to continue
DOE market – we are recognized in the lab community due to past success –we should have a
cohesive strategy for all labs and sites should have a strategy for their path to cloud
Financial Services and Utility Industry – we’ve had a lot of PeopleSoft and cloud erp success in
Financial Services and PeopleSoft and cloud hcm in utilities
Advisory/support – We’ve done some advisory and support and had success –continue
Day 0/Day 1/Day 2 Services - With HCM, we are doing well with Day 1, with ERP Day 2 –need to be
great in both for each practice and extend to day 0 (see next slides)
E Payments (p card, virtual card) – a lot of success, but no marketing yet around success
in this market. Need to build out competency and showcase successes
ADP Tax Filings – Oracle does not deliver reports for tax filings. ADP and Ceridian are
primary providers, with ADP being most common. Our clients do not like ADP. PeopleSoft
delivered this out of the box. We built a handful of states for ASRC and could develop
reports for all state and resell for future clients.
Oracle Me, Journeys – Bells and whistles of the product that are one of the value props
for oracle hcm. This is usually add on work after Day 1 implementation. We need to do
Day 1 well enough to stay with client for Day 2 and have Day 2 services for new clients
that are unsatisfied with existing SI
Automated Testing – Oracle delivers patches quarterly and customers need to test their
system. PeopleSoft automated testing has been successful at Elire–we have developed a
strategy, but haven’t yet found a customer. We need to refine our strategy –our current
automated testing strategy needs to be more comprehensive (in progress)

### Growth Opportunities – Core Competency

### Day 0, Day 1, Day 2 Services

```
Existing Products New
```

**Day 0 Services** – Preplanning for cloud transition

- Path to cloud/journey to cloud. We need to partner with MAS and OnPrem to build this out fully.
- We need to be part of our customers cloud j ourney from start to finish.
- Day 0 is all of the work we can be doing together to understand where they are on their roadmap, helping them with their roadmap, prepping them for their transition for cloud (especially for our existing active PS
  customers ), helping them with expectations of what a transformation looks like, and then ultimately feeding them into our cloud delivery teams. We need to utilize the tools built by the OnPrem team to help us understand
  where they are in their PeopleS oft journey to better as ses s and evaluate what their path to cloud looks like and partner with SAS to help them define their roadmap and business process redesign opportunities
  **Day 1 Services** – Implementation
- For Day 0 customers, this is an easier path - we know them, we know how to move them and what their pain points are and we know how to scope the project and set expectations for a s mooth transition.
- This is laying the groundwork – its not the bells and whistles you see in the oracle demos – its setting the foundation for the bells and whistles. We need to improve our methodology so that we are better at performing
  these transitions and we need to be better at setting expectations so that they know this is just step 1 in their journey.
- We need to also keep in mind that many of our clients won’t be Day 0 customers (RFP responses where we don’t have knowledge of where they’re at and what they’re doing). For these ”Blind” rfp res ponses , we need to do
  a better job of telling the story in our RFPs so that we appropriately set expectations. This is just Day 1...we need to lay the foundation
- We need a more repeatable and lower cost implementation methodolog y to make sure we get to day 2 as well as consultants that are trained on our methodology
  **Day 2 Services** – this is where the fun begins
- The ultimate vision of these cloud systems are big ideas like automated payroll or month end closes using AI. Some of that is still a ways out in the future, but some of these future state visions are here now.
- Day 2 is about building out true business value for our customers – this is where we see real ROI.
- In the OnPrem model, we used to be able to rely on upgrades. Once people implemented PeopleSoft, 3-5 years later, they would upgrade. Recently, we’ve been shortening that window due to PUM updates, but it had the
  potential to be a more reliable revenue stream. With cloud, this has the potential to be the clients LAST implementation. Updates are automatic. H ow does a s ervice company make money once all customers are on
  cloud?? New features and functionality. There will ALWAYS be new features and functionality – but we need to change our approach to capture business. Rather than simply upgrading, we need to be thought leaders and
  be on top of trends in the product. We need to partner with our clients
- We have 3 main entry points.
  1. Customers that we performed Day 1 – these are cus tomers we know. We know what went well, what needs to be optimized and what the future looks like. We need to develop a strategy for these customers to
     help them on their journey. Oracle is always adding new features and functionality – we need to stay on top of trends and advise and engage with them on understanding if they know the trend/new area and then
     being able to guide them on that journey (great example is autocomplete in HC M – Cloud world interactions with Yum allowed Aaron to recognize an opportunity and create an opportunity on helping them with
     this new technology)
  2. Customers that have failed or unsatisfactory D ay 1 implementations - we’ve had a lot of success in cloud erp in this space. SI that didn’t’ meet expectations or simply looking for a new partner
  3. Marketing: S howcasing our expertise in being able to help clients recognize the value in their cloud systems. This is a two part strategy – first, staying on top of trends and being able to demonstrate value, and
     next, being able to convey the value and get the message out through marketing and relationships. A two fold example – new technology in oracle cloud called auto complete – Karen Long is doing work at INL on
     the technology. Marketing made a YouTube video, Lucas county reached out and we’ve now had several conversations to replace their incumbent SI. Same technology, but looking at the relations hip side, Aaron
     met with Yum at Cloud World conference and found out they are struggling with the same technology. Suggested Karen and we are now working on an S OW that should be s igned in the next week

What capabilities and resources will be needed to capture the value of these opportunities

- PeopleSoft to Cloud
  - Develop Tools and accelerators to help PeopleSoft clients move to cloud (Cloud Conversion Toolkit)
  - Develop strategy for existing clients and understand their path to cloud
  - Incorporate PeopleSoft customization identification tool and SAS Roadmap into cohesive methodology for transformation
- Federal Cloud
  - Continue to develop oracle relationships – Tamara and her reps
  - Complete JV with Metric5
  - Develop in house contract expertise to handle federal contracts
- Methodology
  - Lower Cost and more repeatable Execution model
- Sales Strategy
  - External relationships – within oracle and leveraging trusted clients
  - Cohesive messaging on what we do
  - Referenceable customers
- Structure and Training
  - Need to be able to carry a bench going forward – operating at 100% capacity was not allowing us to chase new opportunities and when Sandia and Hanford fell
    through, we did not have a backlog of services
  - Grow internal consulting knowledge
  - Consulting training – module, roadmap, consulting 101
- Industry Knowledge
  - To be our clients trusted advisors, we need to be able to understand the problems they face. Its not enough to say we understand the software, we need to
    understand their industry and the unique solutions that can help them in their cloud transformation.
  - Strongest existing markets – utilities, financial services, labs. Out of those, in the lab space, we are building repeatable solutions, but we still are very immature
    in understanding how their business actually works
  - New markets we need to understand – Tribes, Federal, State/Local

## Pre-work

- How do our various offerings connect for our clients (not just in our opinion but how it is viewed by
  our clients)? Is there a unifying thread across all the opportunity areas? What is it? How would
  you describe it in six words? Is it currently clear to us, our employees, our clients, our strategic
  partners, our competitors?
- Which opportunities are a “fit” with our strengths?
- Which opportunities support achievement of our financial goals – Revenue, 40% Gross Margin,
  15% EBITDA?
- What should the role of Management Advisory Services be at Elire?
- What are the implications (positive or negative) of having two business models, e.g., project based
  Consulting and Managed Services/Success Hub with their Recurring Revenue Model?
- What capabilities will be needed to meet clients’ emerging needs, e.g., data analytics, block chain,
  AI? Will they be tickets to play at our clients?
- To what extent do we grow through acquisitions?

- The Pillar has struggled to hit
  utilization goals due to issues
  in a few practices, such as
  TRAS and SaaS TR
- Average project profit margin
  is also below goal primarily
  due to the use of higher cost
  subcontractors although bill
  rates have been increasing
  over time, which should help
- The Pillar needs to continue
  to improve QA checks and
  expand the use of PSA to
  proactively monitor projects

ELIRE INC. 2022

## Pillar Progress and Vision

**Capability area Reflection +/- 2025 where are we going?**

1. Use of PSA for Project and Resource
   Management supported by a PMO with
   quality reviews & measurements
   - Deployed PSA for basic use and
     are actively taking steps to use in
     a more advanced & integrated
     way
   - PMO Health checks have stalled
     but restarting
     \- Want to use PSA to support sales cycle, as well
     as to support project status reporting
     \- Want an independent quality review team to
     ensure living up to Trusted Advisor status
2. Collaborative Portal • Working to deploy better
   organized MS Teams and
   Sharepoint
   \- Build a db of methodology and deliverable
   examples. Harvest good examples of
   deliverables at project close and ensure
   documents are tagged for searching
3. Critical thinking skills to solve client
   problems, mitigate risk and introduce best
   practices
   - Consultants know how to
     configure applications but are
     always providing thought
     leadership on process
     transformation
     \- Want consultants to more proactively provide
     advice to clients to transform there processes
     rather than lift & shift
4. Effective Change Management • Have basic change management
   for ERP projects
   \- Want PROSCI enabled OCM integrated into all
   applicable methodologies
5. Expand industry specific expertise for
   COEs
   - We know the app but lack deep
     expertise in targeted industries
     \- Need to understand their specific problems
     that need to be solved to be a trusted advisor

## Pre-work

- Across the pillars, what are the 3 most critical capabilities we must invest in?

## Talent of the Future

ELIRE INC. 2022

#### Professional

#### Services Maturity

#### Benchmark

```
Unlike other Professional Service
Firms, our IT consulting model does
not support consistently reliable
underutilized Delivery roles other
than the SDM role
Elire currently uses 30-40% 1099
Contractors rather than the
Benchmark 13-14% for IT
Consulting firms
```

## Elire Today - Client Delivery

```
Tier 1: Associates & Consultants: 17
Tier 2: Senior & Managing: 27
Tier 3: Principle & Solution Architect: 17
Tier 4: Practice Leads &
Associate Practice
Leads: 10
```

Elire is not so much a pyramid as a diamond

Some areas have no Tier 3 resources

Some areas have no Tier 1 resources

Elire has a proven history of being able to take
individuals whom it was considered impossible
to remove from the day to day of projects
(COEs). This was achieved by creating Practice
Leads. Many of the Practice Leads have now
significantly reduced their Utilization.

We can continue forward if we have an
increased number of solid resources at Tier 3
who are able to be Project PMs, Thread Leads,
Team Leads, etc. That need is essential.

## Elire Leader of the Future

*Attributes of anElireleader of the future: growing middle leadership is important as we grow, what are our expectations for
leaders at Elire?*

- **Skills:** Coach and Mentor mentality
- **Expectations:** A top Elire priority must prioritize Growing and Nurturing Team Elire by developing authentic manager

```
relationships where they provide opportunities to Lead, Learn and Feel Proud in a Psychologically Safe environment and
where they know how to successfully manage capability gaps (skill profiles), motivation gap (desire profiles), and license
gaps (agency profiles). Ultimately, drive firm growth, reducing attrition, growing the next generation of leaders
```

- **Behaviors:** Self-motivated, thought leader in area, fluid, adaptable, passionate, professional, nurturing, and authentically
  engaging
- **Actions:**
  - Develop/purchase necessary management training courses for all people managers
  - Teach our managers how to achieve the above expectations
  - Add additional layers of management and engagement support systems to improve the span of control

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

- Identify those higher order key tasks that **should** be performed by COE and
  Practice Leadership and **re-allocate all** other tasks
- **Remove lower value tasks to other FTEs**
  o **Pillar or Group of COE Admin Assistant (Cost)** : Scheduling meetings, routine
  follow-up, assist with RFP template first drafts, estimators first draft, assist
  with project-based review logistics, training and other follow-up
  o **PMO - Project Analyst/Coordinator (indirectly Covered):** Project onboarding
  support; Project Teams/SharePoint support; SOW spend analysis; anything
  PSA: assignments, Vendor Budget, non “auto approval” time/invoice approval
  (F&O already working to increase “auto approval” on timecard and invoices),
  resource extensions, data audits; project scorecard/plan tasks (monitoring,
  follow up on action items, deadline reviews). Paid via SOW fee
- Different from Billable PMs
  o **Reviews** : Move from Practice Lead driven at Mid Year, End of Year to more
  frequent Project Based Reviews given by Project Leader that knows resource
  best (see slide 82)
- **Allow Focus on**
  o Strategy (alignment of Service Offerings to marketplace needs)
  o Sales Management (including Strategic Partner and Client Executive
  Relationships)
  o Delivery Management via SDM roles to ensure Success Delivered

### Reallocate

### Lower Value

### Add Tasks

Address the “Additive Nature” of
the Practice Lead Position

Key to the Pyramid

**Delivery Teams (Tier 1-3): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Success Delivered*
- To help ensure more timely reviews and lead to better overall project performance, delivery consultants

```
would NOW receive a Performance Review at the end of each Project or at the end of Key Milestones.
Should Project Timelines prevent individuals from being reviewed more than once per year
```

- Reviews will be conducted by the resource’s designated Sub Team Lead, Team Lead, Thread Lead, or Project

```
Lead depending upon the size and complexity of the Project. IF there is no Elire designated individual able
to perform that role, the review will be done at the Practice Leadership level
```

- *Rationale* : Most projects are 7 months so most would have at least two project ending reviews and/or a

```
key milestone reviews a year. The designated Elire Lead knows the Team Elire resource better than anyone
for the duration of the project. This should improve the overall accuracy of reviews and help ensure that
resources are set-up for success on their next project. This will also spread reviews throughout the year
rather than consolidating them at the Mid Year Point. The Year End process will simply aggregate reviews.
```

- Reviews will be aggregated at the end of the year by Practice Leadership

**Day to Day Project Supervisors (Tier 3): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Day to Day Project Supervisor for the duration of the Project ensuring Success Delivered and*

*Provide Project Ending/Key Milestone Reviews to their Project Team*

- Roles: Serve as Team Leads, Thread Leads, Project PMs depending on size and complexity of project
- Rationale: Need a core group of solid Project Leads who can be relied upon to deliver success outside of

```
the COE and Practice Lead to allow Practice Leads and Associate Practice Leads to scale back their
Utilization.
```

- ***Oversight of Day to Day Project Team Members.\*** **Provide on the job training and mentoring, oversee**

```
deliverables, provide soft skills coaching all with the goal of ensuring Project Success. Help ensure the
"roll my chair over" culture of project support.
```

- ***Add a grade/score for 1099 Contractors - Friends of Elire\***
- *Goal: Oversite of teams of 4-12 made up of Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3 who are overseen on a day-to-day basis by*

*the Elire Team Lead, Thread Lead, Project PM. Standard 83% utilization*

**Associate Practice Leads (Tier 4):** ***new\***

- *Primary Focus: Delivery Support, Client Engagement*
- Roles: SDM on no more than 3-4 projects
- Rationale: Client Engagement via SDM role focusing on understanding the transformational needs of the client that can

```
be addressed by Elire's offerings (allow better penetration and cross selling) and then ensure projects beneath are
running smoothly, coordinate with PMO accordingly. Must nurture deeper, longer-term relationships
```

- ***Oversight of Day to Day Project Supervisors on 3-4 projects where have SDM responsibility. Ensure project-based\***

```
reviews are occurring. Option to have direct line employees IF the Practice organizes resources by function or type
```

- **Bi-annual Career Growth/Purpose conversations for those with direct day to day project supervisors as they are getting**

```
detailed reviews but still need career growth guidance. Provide BOTH core project reviews and career growth/purpose
guidance for those WITHOUT a day-to-day Elire Supervisor on a Project
```

- *Goal: Oversite of no more than 3-4 projects (20-30 FTEs max) depending upon their size and complexity therefore the*

```
underlying teams would be 12 to 24. Four projects with 2-5 SDM hrs per week each is 8-20 hours (20% to 50% utilization)
```

- *Requires: A practice that has more than 3-4 projects with more than 20-30 FTEs* ***AND\*** *solid Tier 3 resources who can take*

```
on Project Leadership positions so the APL can focus on SDM roles only
```

**Practice Leads (Tier 4): exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Sales Support, Strategic Direction of Practice, and P&L Management*
- Rationale: Research and understanding of key driving trends in key industries and transformational trends

```
that are motivating client P&L owners and then ensure Practice has the necessary Service Offerings with
the underlying methodology/tools/templates to ensure we can deliver success. Work with Client
Relationships to ensure RSMs and Sales Pods have the materials they need to be successful: Success
Stories, etc. to link "What We Do" to "What We Sell" in a coordinated Go to Market Strategy
```

- ***Oversight of Associate Practice Leads (new position see prior slide)\***
- **Monthly Practice Meeting: review Critical Communication Cascade, provide more detailed Quarterly**

**Meeting Updates on sales and financials as they are available**

- **Annual Aggregation of Review for Promotions and Raises**
- *Goal: 2 hrs per week Executive Committees and/or Client Executive Relationship Management on largest,*

*most strategic projects (5% utilization)*

- *Requires: Solid resources able to be Associate Practice Lead role at the desired Utilization and solid Tier 3*

**Center of Excellence Leads: exists today**

- *Primary Focus: Go to Market Sales Strategy for COE, Employee Engagement, High level Client and Strategic*

*Partner Executive Engagement*

- Rationale: Partners are the "special sauce" for authentic Employee Engagement and meaningful Executive

and Strategic Partner Relationships

- ***Oversight of Practice Leads, regularly check in on Practice Lead meetings and informally with team\***
- **Monitor key Service Execution Metrics for the COE and ensure overall financial health of COE**
- *Goal: 0% utilized while overseeing a max of 60-90 Employees/Billable FTEs*

```
ELIRE INC. 2022
```

- Today, the 3% is “given” simply for having billable resources. There
  was an assumption that Team Size and Utilization would naturally
  increase but the incentive has not been sufficient
- The goal would be to make participants ***earn\*** the percentages given
  in the same way that Partners must ***earn\*** the percentages given
- High-level look shows would have marginal impact on EBITA

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the Elire Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Phase 3 project - a PostgreSQL database system and UI specification for managing organizational ownership, attribution, KPIs, and financial data. The system implements a "Rosetta Stone" concept that connects value streams, organizational units, people, KPIs, systems of record, and financials.

## Database Commands

### Setup and Migration
```bash
# Initialize the database (run in order)
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/1-tables_and_types.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/2-seed.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/3-value_streams_systems_attribution.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/4-kpis_and_targets.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/5-Financials_rates.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/6-rosetta_stone.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/7-updates.sql
psql -d your_database -f elire_ops_1/8-updates.sql
```

### Common Queries
```sql
-- View the core Rosetta Stone data
SELECT * FROM v_rosetta_stone ORDER BY stream, unit_code;

-- Check organizational rollups
SELECT * FROM v_org_rollup;

-- View financial rollups
SELECT * FROM v_financial_rollup;

-- Check stream rollups
SELECT * FROM v_stream_rollup;

-- View truth table (expected vs observed ownership)
SELECT * FROM v_rosetta_truth ORDER BY stream_code, unit_code;

-- Check misattribution status
SELECT * FROM v_misattribution_delta WHERE is_misattributed = true;
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Concepts

1. **Atomic Units**: The fundamental work units that connect all dimensions (20 core units plus SELL sub-phases)
2. **Value Streams**: Primary workflow spine - WIN, DELIVER, COLLECT, TALENT, OPERATE
3. **Organizational Hierarchy**: Pillars → Departments/COEs → Practices → People
4. **Ownership Model**: Expected (role@org) vs Observed (actual) ownership tracking
5. **Evidence System**: Immutable audit trail of all ownership changes and KPI measurements

### Key Database Views

- `v_rosetta_stone_enhanced`: Core view joining units with streams, orgs, systems, and KPIs
- `v_rosetta_truth`: Expected vs observed ownership with status flags
- `v_org_tree`: Hierarchical org structure with financial rollups
- `v_stream_tree`: Value stream hierarchy with unit counts
- `v_financial_rollup`: Direct P&L by org unit
- `v_financial_rollup_with_sga`: Allocated P&L including SG&A distribution
- `v_observed_from_evidence`: Evidence log formatted for UI display

### Data Principles

- **Append-only history**: Never update observed ownership rows - always INSERT new ones
- **Latest wins in views**: Views automatically select the most recent observation
- **Evidence everywhere**: Every meaningful change creates an evidence_log entry
- **Natural key idempotency**: Use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING for safe refreshes

## UI Implementation Approach

### Critical Architecture Principle: DATABASE-DRIVEN, NOT UI-DRIVEN

The UI must be a thin visualization layer over database views. The database structure IS the solution:
- **All rollups calculated in SQL views**, never in JavaScript
- **Hierarchical relationships defined in database**, not frontend
- **API endpoints are simple passthroughs** to database views
- **Editing happens at atomic unit level**, rollups cascade naturally

### Core Pages (Data-Driven Trees)

1. **/org** - Organizational tree with ownership alignment rollups
   - Shows: Pillars → COEs → Practices with alignment metrics
   - Data from: `v_org_tree_with_ownership` (enhanced view)
   - Displays: Headcount, Revenue, Margin, Aligned/Misattributed/Not Observed counts

2. **/streams** - Value stream tree with editable unit ownership
   - Shows: Streams → Sub-streams → Atomic Units
   - Data from: `v_stream_tree_with_ownership`
   - Features: Inline editing with dropdowns for org/role selection
   - Real-time rollups after edits

3. **/truth** - Paginated truth table (expected vs observed)
   - Data from: `v_rosetta_truth`
   - Features: Filtering, pagination, bulk operations

4. **/evidence** - Audit trail
5. **/kpis** - Metrics management  
6. **/finance** - P&L views

### API Endpoints

#### Tree/Hierarchy Endpoints (READ-ONLY from views)
- GET `/api/tree/org-with-ownership` - Org tree with ownership stats
- GET `/api/tree/streams-with-ownership` - Stream tree with ownership stats
- GET `/api/streams/[code]/units` - Units for a specific stream

#### Data Modification (WRITE to tables, triggers update views)
- POST `/api/observed-ownership` - Set observed ownership (append-only)
- POST `/api/evidence` - Log evidence entries

#### Option Lists for Dropdowns
- GET `/api/options/org` - Organization dropdown options
- GET `/api/options/role` - Role dropdown options

## Important Notes

### Database Schema Evolution
- Keep view signatures stable as they form the UI contract
- Internal table changes are fine as long as views remain compatible
- Use `8-updates.sql` for schema improvements and new views

### Data Integrity Rules
- Unit codes follow pattern: `STREAM-##` (e.g., WIN-01, DELIVER-03)
- Organization codes use underscores: `PILLAR_SERVICE_EXEC`
- Role codes use underscores: `DELIVERY_LEAD`
- Evidence types are enumerated: `ownership_update`, `kpi_measurement`, `pricing_decision`, etc.
- System refs: `CRM`, `PSA`, `FIN`, `HCM`, `DOC`, `UI`

### Current State vs Future State
- Expected ownership is pre-seeded based on organizational design
- Observed ownership starts empty - to be filled via UI to expose misattribution
- Financial data has 2025 budget loaded; actuals to be added with type='actual'
- Person facts have placeholder allocations; replace with PSA actuals over time

### KPI Strategy
- Leading KPIs (controllable drivers) linked at unit level
- Lagging KPIs (outcomes) linked at stream/firm level
- Current SPI-derived KPIs maintained for continuity
- Operational KPIs added for true driver management

## Key Implementation Insights

### The Rosetta Stone Vision
The system connects everything through atomic units - the smallest indivisible work elements. These units:
- Belong to exactly one value stream (WIN, DELIVER, COLLECT, etc.)
- Have expected ownership (who SHOULD own it per org design)
- Have observed ownership (who ACTUALLY owns it in reality)
- Roll up naturally through both org and stream hierarchies

### WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) Principles
- **Strict hierarchy**: Every element has exactly one parent
- **Complete decomposition**: Work is fully broken down to atomic level
- **Natural aggregation**: Metrics roll up through the hierarchy automatically
- **Data-driven structure**: The database schema defines the business logic

### Why Trees, Not Tables
- Tables show flat data; trees show relationships and cascading impacts
- Misattribution at the atomic level cascades up through org hierarchy
- Users can see HOW ownership gaps aggregate at each level
- Editing at leaf level (atomic units) naturally updates all rollups

## Testing Approach

Key test scenarios:
1. **Misattribution signal**: Set observed owner different from expected, verify status changes
2. **Evidence trail**: Confirm all updates create evidence_log entries
3. **Financial rollups**: Verify practice → COE → pillar aggregations
4. **Ownership rollups**: Edit unit ownership, verify tree rollups update
5. **Cross-hierarchy views**: Filter org tree by stream, stream tree by org

# Elire WBS Phase 3 - Rosetta Console

A PostgreSQL-backed business intelligence dashboard that implements the "Rosetta Stone" concept - connecting value streams, organizational units, people, KPIs, systems of record, and financials into a unified operational view.

## Overview

The Rosetta Console provides a value stream-centric interface for managing organizational ownership, attribution, KPIs, and financial data. It exposes misattribution between expected and observed ownership, enabling organizations to identify and correct operational inefficiencies.

## Key Features

### Value Stream Dashboard
- **Three-panel layout**: Stream navigator, units grid, and KPI cascade
- **Real-time ownership tracking**: Expected vs. observed ownership with status indicators
- **Inline editing**: Click-to-edit functionality for all data points
- **Misattribution visibility**: Color-coded status (aligned/misattributed/not observed)
- **Financial impact**: Shows the cost of misattribution ($2.4M example)

### Stream Detail Pages (`/stream/[code]`)
- Dedicated views for each value stream (WIN, DELIVER, COLLECT, TALENT, OPERATE)
- Simplified inline editing without dropdowns unless clicked
- Real-time status updates

### Data Management
- **Append-only history**: Never updates observed ownership, always inserts new records
- **Evidence trail**: All changes create immutable audit log entries
- **Natural key idempotency**: Safe data refreshes using ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14.2.5 with App Router, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: PostgreSQL with complex relational schema
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for all data operations
