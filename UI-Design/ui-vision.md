# UI Narrative Goals

## The Story We're Telling Through Software

### The Problem Made Visible

Every professional services firm believes they understand their business through org charts, P&Ls, and utilization reports. But these are comfortable fictions. The truth lives in the gap between who should do work and who actually does it—and that gap is killing margins while burning out the people who actually deliver value.

### What This UI Must Accomplish

#### 1. **Expose the Hidden Organization**

The real organization isn't the org chart. It's the network of who actually makes decisions, who carries the burden, and where value is created. This UI makes that network visible for the first time.

Every atomic unit of work becomes a lens. Through it, you can see:

- The official owner (the fiction we maintain)
- The actual owner (the exhausted hero doing the work)
- The cost of that gap (in hours, dollars, and human suffering)

#### 2. **Quantify the Burden**

"COEs are overwhelmed" is an opinion. "Cloud Enterprise COE carries 347 hours/month of sales work worth $52,000 in unbillable time" is a fact that demands action.

The UI must make burden tangible:

- Hours of work being done by the wrong people
- Dollar value of that misallocated effort
- Percentage of capacity consumed by others' responsibilities

#### 3. **Connect Decisions to Outcomes**

That 10% discount doesn't just reduce revenue—it cascades through resource decisions, scope compromises, and quality tradeoffs. The UI must show these connections in real-time.

When someone asks "Can we discount?", the UI shows:

- Who's actually making that decision (rarely who should)
- What margins become after the discount
- Which downstream compromises become necessary
- The cycle time impact of the decision process itself

#### 4. **Make AI Readiness Tangible**

"We need to be AI-ready" is abstract. "This unit scores 30% on AI readiness because ownership is undefined, evidence lives in email, and KPIs aren't measured" is actionable.

For each unit of work, show:

- Can AI enhance this today? (Usually no)
- What's blocking AI from helping? (Specific gaps)
- What's the opportunity cost? (Competitors gaining 40% efficiency here)

### The User Journey

#### Day 1: Recognition

A COE lead opens the Rosetta page for "WIN-03 Pricing Decision". They see themselves as the observed owner when Sales should own it. They see 72-hour cycle times when the target is 24. They see their team spending 47 hours/month on this. The problem is no longer abstract.

#### Week 1: Revelation

As more observed ownership is captured, patterns emerge. The Insights dashboard shows that Service Execution carries 40% of Client Relationships' work. That Finance provides data 6 weeks late. That Talent doesn't actually plan workforce needs. The organizational fiction collapses, replaced by operational truth.

#### Month 1: Redistribution

Armed with evidence, leaders can finally have real conversations. Not "Sales should own pricing" but "Sales owning pricing would save COEs 347 hours/month and reduce cycle time by 48 hours, improving win rate by 7%." Ownership starts shifting to where it belongs.

#### Quarter 1: Results

With clear ownership, defined work, and visible KPIs:

- Cycle times drop (24-hour pricing decisions)
- Margins improve (scope capture increases)
- Burnout decreases (people do their actual jobs)
- AI enhancement becomes possible (defined, owned, measured work)

### Design Principles

#### 1. **Truth Over Comfort**

Never hide uncomfortable realities. If COEs are drowning, show it in red. If margins are negative, make them blink. Comfort preserves dysfunction.

#### 2. **Evidence Over Opinion**

Every claim must be traceable to evidence. Not "Sales doesn't do discovery" but "17 of 20 solution outlines last month were created by COE leads (evidence: PSA timesheets)."

#### 3. **Impact Over Activity**

Don't show that misattribution exists—show what it costs. Don't show KPIs are missed—show the revenue impact. Make every metric tie to money or time.

#### 4. **Clarity Over Completeness**

Better to show 5 critical things clearly than 50 things poorly. Each page should answer one question completely rather than many questions partially.

### Success Metrics for the UI

1. **Adoption**: Are people recording observed ownership weekly?
2. **Accuracy**: Does observed ownership match evidence from systems?
3. **Action**: Are ownership patterns changing based on insights?
4. **Acceleration**: Are cycle times decreasing?
5. **AI Readiness**: Are units becoming more AI-enhanceable?

### The Ultimate Test

In 90 days, when someone asks "Can we discount 10%?", the UI should provide:

- Who should make this decision (Sales)
- Who will actually make it (COE lead)
- How long it will take (72 hours currently, 24 hour target)
- What it will cost in margin (5% becomes -2%)
- What compromises it requires (offshore resources, compressed timeline)
- Whether AI could help (not until ownership is clear)

If the UI can answer that question completely in under 60 seconds, we've succeeded.

### The Transformation

This isn't just a database UI. It's an organizational CAT scan that shows where the cancer of misattribution is killing the business. It's a blueprint for redistributing work to where it belongs. It's a readiness assessment for an AI-augmented future.

Most importantly, it's a path from heroic suffering to systematic success. From undefined chaos to enhanced clarity. From working harder to working smarter.

The UI doesn't just display data—it drives transformation by making the invisible visible, the intangible tangible, and the impossible inevitable.
